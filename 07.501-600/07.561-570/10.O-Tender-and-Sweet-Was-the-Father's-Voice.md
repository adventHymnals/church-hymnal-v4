1.
O tender and sweet was the Father's voice 
As He lovingly called to me, 
"Come over the line, it is only a step; 
I'm waiting, My child, for thee." 
Refrain:
"Over the line," hear the sweet refrain; 
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
"Over the line"'Why should I remain 
With a step between me and Jesus? 

2.
"But my sins are so many, my faith so small"' 
Lo! the answer came quick and clear, 
"Thou needest not trust in thyself at all; 
Step over the line. I'm here." 

3.
"But my flesh is so feeble," with tears I said, 
"And the pathway I cannot see; 
I fear if I try I may sadly fail, 
And thus dishonor Thee." 

4.
The world is so cold I cannot go back, 
Press forward I surely must; 
I'll lay my weak hand in His wounded palm, 
Step over the line and trust.
