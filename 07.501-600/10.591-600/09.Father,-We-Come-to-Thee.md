```txt

1.
Father, we come to Thee, 
No other help have we; 
Thou wilt our refuge be, 
On Thee we call, 
Earth is but dark and drear 
Without Thy presence near; 
Be Thou our comfort here, 
Father of all. 
Refrain:
Father, we come to Thee, 
Turn not away; 
Helpless we come to Thee, 
Hear while we pray. 

2.
Save from our many foes, 
Savefrom our earthly woes; 
Be Thou our soul's repose 
In time of need. 
Doubting are we, and weak; 
To us sweet courage speak; 
Thy mighty arm we seek 
For strength indeed. 

3.
Give us Thy grace divine, 
Seal us forever Thine; 
Our wayward feet incline 
From sin to flee. 
Oh, guide us, we implore, 
Till weary life is o'er, 
And on a brighter shore 
We dwell with Thee.
