## 593. LOOK UPON JESUS, SINLESS IS HE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Look upon Jesus, sinless is He; 
Father, impute His life unto me. 
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe, 
Cover with His life, whiter than snow. 
Refrain:
Cover with His life, whiter than snow; 
Fullness of His life then shall I know; 
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe, 
Cover with His life, whiter than snow. 

2.
Deep are the wounds transgression has made; 
Red are the stains; my soul is afraid. 
O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee, 
Safe from the law that now judgeth me! 

3.
Longing the joy of pardon to know; 
Jesus holds out a robe white as snow; 
'Lord, I accept it! leaving my own, 
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.' 

4.
Reconciled by His death for my sin, 
Justified by His life pure and clean, 
Sanctified by obeying His Word, 
Glorified when returneth my Lord.
