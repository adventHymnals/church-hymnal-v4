```txt

1.
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole, 
I want Thee forever to live in my soul; 
Break down every idol, cast out every foe; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
Refrain:
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

2.
Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies, 
And help me to make a complete sacrifice; 
I give up myself and whatever I know; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

3.
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat; 
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet; 
By faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

4.
Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait; 
Come now, and within me a new heart create; 
To those who have sought Thee, Thou never saidst, No; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
