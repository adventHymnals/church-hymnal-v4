####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
I know my heavenly Father knows 
The storms that would my way oppose; 
But He can drive the clouds away. 
And turn my darkness into day, 
And turn my darkness into day. 
Refrain:
He knows, He knows 
The storms that would my way oppose; 
He knows, He knows, 
And tempers every wind that blows. 

2.
I know my heavenly Father knows 
The balm I need to soothe my woes; 
And with His touch of love divine 
He heals this wounded soul of mine, 
He heals this wounded soul of mine. 

3.
I know my heavenly Father knows 
How frail I am to meet my foes; 
But He my cause will e'er defend, 
Uphold and keep me to the end, 
Uphold and keep me to the end. 

4.
I know my heavenly Father knows 
The hour my journey here will close; 
And may that hour, O faithful Guide, 
Find me safe sheltered by Thy side, 
Find me safe sheltered by Thy side.
