## 595. JESUS, KEEP ME NEAR THE CROSS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Jesus, keep me near the cross, 
There a precious fountain 
Free to all, a healing stream, 
Flows from Calvary's mountain. 
Refrain:
In the cross, in the cross, 
Be my glory ever, 
Till my raptured soul shall find 
Rest beyond the river. 

2.
Near the cross, a trembling soul, 
Love and mercy found me; 
There the bright and Morning Star 
Sheds its beams around me. 

3.
Near the cross! O Lamb of God, 
Bring its scenes before me; 
Help me walk from day to day, 
With its shadow o'er me. 

4.
Near the cross I'll watch and wait, 
Hoping, trusting ever, 
Till I reach the golden strand, 
Just beyond the river.

```
