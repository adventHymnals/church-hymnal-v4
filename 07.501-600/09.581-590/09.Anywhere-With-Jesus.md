#### Advent Hymnals
## 589. ANYWHERE WITH JESUS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
CHORUS:
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

2.
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

3.
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the darkening shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.

```
