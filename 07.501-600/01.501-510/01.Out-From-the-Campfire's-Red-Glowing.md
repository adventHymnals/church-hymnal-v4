        Church Hymnal 1941 501. Out From the Campfire's Red Glowing.  Out from the campfire's red glowing,  Cheerfully shedding its light,  On to the pickets we're going,  For the long watches of night;  Let us be careful that slumber  Press not our eyelids too hard'  Surely not one of our number  Must be found sleeping on guard.

####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Out from the campfire's red glowing, 
Cheerfully shedding its light, 
On to the pickets we're going, 
For the long watches of night; 
Let us be careful that slumber 
Press not our eyelids too hard' 
Surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard. 
Refrain:
Yes, sleeping on guard, 
Sleeping on guard, 
No! surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard. 

2.
Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning; 
Hark to the revelry there! 
Waiting the conflict returning, 
Scouts are abroad everywhere; 
We must be watchful and ready, 
See every entrance is barred, 
Keeping our heads cool and steady' 
All is lost, sleeping on guard. 

3.
Our aim is vigilance ever, 
We can allow no defeat; 
Truehearted soldiers will never 
Join in the coward's retreat; 
Wary and watchful be keeping, 
Though the task be e'er so hard, 
Knowing what dangers come creeping 
When we are sleeping on guard.
