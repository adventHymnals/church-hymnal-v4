## 507. O GOD, BENEATH THY GUIDING HAND
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
O God, beneath Thy guiding hand 
Our exiled fathers crossed the sea; 
And when they trod the wintry strand, 
With prayer and psalm they worshiped Thee. 

2.
Thou heardest, well pleased, the song, the prayer; 
Thy blessing came; and still its power 
Shall onward, through all ages, bear 
The memory of that holy hour. 

3.
Laws, freedom, truth, and faith in God 
Came with those exiles o'er the waves; 
And, where their pilgrim feet have trod, 
The God they trusted guards their graves. 

4.
And here Thy Name, 0 God of love, 
Their children's children shall adore, 
Till these eternal hills remove, 
And spring adorns the earth no more.
