####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
My country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, 
Of thee I sing; 
Land where my fathers died, 
Land of the pilgrims' pride, 
From every mountainside 
Let freedom ring. 

2.
My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble free, 
Thy name I love; 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills; 
My heart with rapture thrills 
Like that above. 

3.
Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees 
Sweet freedom's song: 
Let mortal tongues awake; 
Let all that breathe partake; 
Let rocks their silence break, 
The sound prolong. 

4.
Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To Thee we sing: 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by Thy might, 
Great God, our King.
