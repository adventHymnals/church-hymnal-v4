####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The golden morning is fast approaching; 
Jesus soon will come 
To take His faithful and happy children 
To their promised home. 
Refrain:
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning 
Piercing through this night of gloom! 
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning 
That will burst the tomb. 

2.
The Gospel summons will soon be carried 
To the nations round; 
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry 
And the trumpet sound. 

3.
Attended by all the shining angels, 
Down the flaming sky 
The Judge will come, and will take His people 
Where they will not die. 

4.
There those loved ones who have long been parted 
Will all meet that day; 
The tears of those who are brokenhearted 
Will be wiped away.
