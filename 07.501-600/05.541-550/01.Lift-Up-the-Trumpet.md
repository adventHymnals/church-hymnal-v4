####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring: 
Jesus is coming again! 
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing: 
Jesus is coming again! 
REFRAIN:
Coming again, coming again, 
Jesus is coming again! 

2.
Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains: 
Jesus is coming again! 
Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain; 
Jesus is coming again! 

3.
Sound it, old ocean, in each mighty wave: 
Jesus is coming again! 
Break on the sands of the shores that ye lave; 
Jesus is coming again! 

4.
Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng: 
Jesus is coming again! 
Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong; 
Jesus is coming again! 

5.
Nations are angry'by this we do know 
Jesus is coming again! 
Knowledge increases; men run to and fro; 
Jesus is coming again!
