####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
I've wandered far away from God, 
Now I'm coming home; 
The paths of sin too long I've trod; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 
REFRAIN:
Coming home, coming home, 
Nevermore to roam, 
Open wide Thine arms of love, 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

2.
I've wasted many precious years, 
Now I'm coming home; 
I now repent with bitter tears; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

3.
I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord, 
Now I'm coming home; 
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy Word; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

4.
My only hope, my only plea, 
Now I'm coming home; 
That Jesus died, and died for me; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

5.
I need His cleansing blood I know, 
Now I'm coming home; 
O wash me whiter than the snow; 
Lord, I'm coming home.
