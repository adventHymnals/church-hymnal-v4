## 559. PASS ME NOT, O GENTLE SAVIOUR
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Pass me not, O gentle Savior, 
Hear my humble cry; 
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by. 
REFRAIN:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry, 
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by. 

2.
Let me at Thy throne of mercy 
Find a sweet relief; 
Kneeling there in deep contrition, 
Help my unbelief. 

3.
Trusting only in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face; 
Heal my wounded, broken spirit, 
Save me by Thy grace. 

4.
Thou the spring of all my comfort, 
More than life to me, 
Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
Whom in heaven but Thee?
