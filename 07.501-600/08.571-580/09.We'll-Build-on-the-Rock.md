#### Advent Hymnals
## 579. WE'LL BUILD ON THE ROCK
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock,
On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;
So shall we abide the fearful shock,
When loud the tempest rages.
Refrain:
We'll build on the Rock,
We'll build on the Rock;
We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
On Christ, the mighty Rock.

2.
Some build on the sinking sands of life,
On visions of earthly treasure;
Some build on the waves of sin and strife,
Of fame, and worldly pleasure.

3.
O build on the Rock, for ever sure,
The firm and the true foundation;
Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
The hope of our salvation.

```
