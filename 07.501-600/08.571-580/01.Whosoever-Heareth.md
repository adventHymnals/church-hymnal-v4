```txt

1.
"Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound! 
Send the blessed tidings all the world around; 
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found: 
"Whosoever will may come." 
Refrain:
"Whosoever will, whosoever will," 
Send the proclamation over vale and hill; 
'Tis a loving Father calls the wanderer home; 
Whosoever will may come. 

2.
Whosoever cometh need not delay; 
Now the door is open, enter while you may; 
Jesus is the true, the only living way: 
Whosoever will may come. 

3.
"Whosoever will," the promise is secure, 
"Whosoever will," forever must endure; 
"Whosoever will," 'tis life forevermore; 
Whosoever will may come.
