####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee! 
Weak and sinful, poor and blind; 
Take my trembling hand and lead me; 
Strength and sight in Thee I find. 
Refrain:
Every hour, every hour, 
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee! 
Every hour, every hour, 
Saviour, keep me every hour. 

2.
Clothe me with Thy robe of meekness, 
Stained with sin this robe of mine; 
Teach me first to feel my weakness, 
Then to plead for strength divine. 

3.
Safe am I if Thou dost guide me' 
Trusting self, how soon I fall! 
Walk life's rugged way beside me, 
Thou, my light, my life, my all. 

4.
Then whate'er the future bringeth, 
Smiles of joy, or tears of grief, 
Still to Thee my spirit clingeth, 
Thou art still my soul's relief.
