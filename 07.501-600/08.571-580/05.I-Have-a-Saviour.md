1.
I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory, 
A dear loving Savior, though earth friends be few; 
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me, 
But oh, that my Savior were your Saviour, too. 
Refrain:
For you I am praying, 
For you I am praying, 
For you I am praying, 
I'm praying for you. 

2.
I have a Father; to me He has given 
A hope for eternity, blessed and true; 
And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven, 
But oh that He'd let me bring you with me too! 

3.
I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness, 
Awaiting in glory my wondering view; 
Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness, 
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too! 

4.
When Jesus has found you, tell others the story, 
That my loving Saviour is your Saviour, too; 
Then pray that your Saviour will bring them to glory, 
And prayer will be answered''twas answered for you!
