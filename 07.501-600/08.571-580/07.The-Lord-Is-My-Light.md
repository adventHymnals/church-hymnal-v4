1.
The Lord is my light; then why should I fear? 
By day and by night His presence is near; 
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin; 
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in. 
Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song; 
By day and by night He leads me along; 
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song; 
By day and by night He leads me along. 

2.
The Lord is my light; though clods may arise, 
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies 
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign: 
Then how can I ever in darkness remain? 

3.
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength; 
I know in His might I'll conquer at length; 
My weakness in mercy He covers with power, 
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour. 

4.
The lord is my light, my all and in all; 
There is in His sight no darkness at all; 
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King; 
With saints and with angels His praises I sing.
