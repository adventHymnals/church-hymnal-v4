## 580. HAVE I NEED OF AUGHT, O SAVIOUR!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Have I need of aught, O Saviour! 
Aught on earth but Thee? 
Have I any in the heavens, 
Anyone but Thee? 
REFRAIN:
Only Thee, only Thee. 
O the wondrous love shown me! 
Only Thee, only Thee, 
None on earth but Thee. 

2.
Though I have of friends so many. 
Love, and gold. and health, 
If I have not Thee, my Saviour, 
Hold I any wealth? 

3.
Is there heart so kind and patient 
With my failings all? 
Or a voice so true and ready, 
Answering my call? 

4.
Not for worlds would I exchange it' 
This sweet faith in Thee! 
Earthly treasures cannot equal 
All Thou art to me.
