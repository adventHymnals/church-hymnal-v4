####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
I have a Friend so precious, 
So very dear to me, 
He loves me with a tender love, 
He loves me faithfully; 
I could not live apart from Him, 
I love to feel Him nigh; 
And so we dwell together, 
My Lord and I. 

2.
Sometimes I'm faint and weary, 
He knows that I am weak; 
And as He bids me lean on Him, 
His help I'll gladly seek; 
He leads me in the path of light, 
Beneath a sunny sky; 
And so we walk together, 
My Lord and I. 

3.
I tell Him all my sorrows, 
I tell Him all my joys, 
I tell Him all that pleases me, 
I tell Him what annoys; 
He tells me what I ought to do, 
Hs tells me how to try; 
And so we talk together, 
My Lord and I. 

4.
He knows how I am longing 
Some weary soul to win, 
And so He bids me go and speak 
The loving word for Him; 
He bids me tell His wondrous love, 
And why He came to die; 
And so we work together, 
My Lord and I.
