```txt
Major Key: D Flat

1.
The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.
CHORUS:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

2.
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

4.
His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
Oh! how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus.

4.
And when He comes to bring the crown- 
The crown of life and glory- 
Then by His side we will sit down 
And tell redemption's story
