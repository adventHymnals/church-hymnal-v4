## 522. NOW JUST A WORD FOR JESUS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Now, just a word for Jesus; 
Your dearest Friend so true, 
Come, cheer our hearts and tell us 
What He has done for you. 
Refrain:
Now just a word for Jesus 
'Twill help us on our way; 
One little word for Jesus, 
O speak, or sing, or pray. 

2.
Now just a word for Jesus; 
You feel your sins forgiven, 
And by His grace are striving 
To reach a home in heaven. 

3.
Now just a word for Jesus; 
A cross it cannot be 
To say, "I love my Saviour 
Who gave His life for me." 

4.
Now just a word for Jesus; 
Let not the time be lost; 
The heart's neglected duty 
Brings sorrow to its cost. 

5.
Now just a word for Jesus; 
And if your faith be dim, 
Arise in all your weakness, 
And leave the rest to Him.
