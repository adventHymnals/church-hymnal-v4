1.
I love to tell the story 
Of unseen things above, 
Of Jesus and His glory, 
Of Jesus and His love. 
I love to tell the story, 
Because I know 'tis true;
It satisfies my longings 
As nothing else can do. 
CHORUS:
I love to tell the story, 
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story 
Of Jesus and His love.

2.
I love to tell the story; 
More wonderful it seems 
Than all the golden fancies 
Of all our golden dreams. 
I love to tell the story, 
It did so much for me; 
And that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee. 

3.
I love to tell the story; 
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it, 
More wonderfully sweet. 
I love to tell the story, 
For some have never heard 
The message of salvation 
From God's own Holy Word.

4.
I love to tell the story, 
For those who know it best 
Seem hungering and thirsting 
To hear it like the rest. 
And when, in scenes of glory, 
I sing the new, new song, 
'Twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long.
