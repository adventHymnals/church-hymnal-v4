## 515. JESUS, WHERE'ER THY PEOPLE MEET
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Jesus, where'er Thy people meet, 
There they behold Thy mercy seat; 
Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found, 
And every place is hallowed ground; 

2.
For Thou, within no walls confined, 
Dost dwell with those of humble mind; 
Such ever bring Thee where they come, 
And, going, take Thee to their home. 

3.
Great Shepherd of Thy chosen few, 
Thy former mercies now renew; 
And to our waiting hearts proclaim 
The sweetness of Thy saving name.
