## 512. GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
God bless our native land! 
May Heaven's protecting hand 
Still guard our shore. 
May peace her power extend, 
Foe be transformed to friend, 
And all our rights depend 
On war no more. 

2.
May just and righteous laws 
Uphold the public cause, 
And bless our name; 
Home of the brave and free, 
Stronghold of liberty, 
We pray that still on thee 
May rest no stain. 

3.
And not this land alone, 
But be Thy mercies known 
From shore to shore; 
O that all men would see 
That they should brothers he, 
And form one family, 
The wide world o'er!
