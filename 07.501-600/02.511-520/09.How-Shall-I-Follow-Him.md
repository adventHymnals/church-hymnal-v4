#### Advent Hymnals
## 519. HOW SHALL I FOLLOW HIM?
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
How shall I follow Him I serve? 
How shall I copy Him I love? 
Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve 
Which lead me to His seat above? 

2.
Lord, should my path through suffering lie, 
Forbid that I should e'er repine; 
Still let me turn to Calvary, 
Nor heed my grief, remembering	Thine. 

3.
O, let me think how Thou didst leave 
The heavenly home of pure delights, 
To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve, 
Through toilsome days, through lonely nights! 

4.
All this Thou didst, then died for me! 
Thou camest not Thyself to please; 
And, dear though earthly comforts be, 
Shall I not love Thee more than these?
