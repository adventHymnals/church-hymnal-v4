        Church Hymnal 1941 514. Ring Out, Wild Bells.  Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,  The flying cloud, the frosty light;  The year will die ere falls the night;  Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.  Ring out the old, ring in the new,  Ring, happy bells, across the snow;  The year is going, let him go;  Ring out the false, ring in the true.

1.
Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, 
The flying cloud, the frosty light; 
The year will die ere falls the night; 
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. 
Ring out the old, ring in the new, 
Ring, happy bells, across the snow; 
The year is going, let him go; 
Ring out the false, ring in the true. 

2.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind, 
For those that here we see no more; 
Ring out the feud of rich and poor, 
Ring in redress to all mankind. 
Ring out false pride in place and blood, 
The civic slander and the spite; 
Ring in the love of truth and right, 
Ring in the common love of good. 

3.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease, 
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold; 
Ring out the thousand wars of old, 
Ring in the thousand years of peace. 
Ring in the valiant man and free, 
The larger heart, the kindlier hand; 
Ring out the darkness of the land, 
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
