```txt

1.
Jesus, and shall it ever be, 
A mortal man, ashamed of Thee? 
Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise, 
Whose glories shine through endless days? 

2.
Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far 
Let evening blush to own a star; 
He sheds the beams of light divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

3.
Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon 
Let midnight be ashamed of noon; 
'Twas midnight with my soul, till He 
Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee. 

4.
Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend 
On Whom my hopes of Heaven depend! 
No; when I blush, be this my shame, 
That I no more revere His Name. 

5.
Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may 
When I've no guilt to wash away; 
No tear to wipe, no good to crave, 
No fears to quell, no soul to save. 
Till then'nor is my boasting vain' 
Till then I boast a Saviour slain: 
And, O, may this my glory be, 
That Christ is not ashamed of me!
