## 174. COME, LORD, AND TARRY NOT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Come, Lord, and tarry not; 
Bring the longlookedfor day; 
O why these years of waiting here? 
O why this long delay? 

2.
Come, for creation groans, 
Impatient of Thy stay; 
Worn out by these long years of ill, 
These ages of delay. 

3.
Come, for the corn is ripe! 
Put in Thy sickle now; 
Reap the great harvest of the earth; 
Sower and reaper Thou. 

4.
Come, spoil the strong man's house, 
Bind him and cast him hence; 
Show Thyself stronger than the strong, 
Thyself Omnipotence. 

5.
Come, and begin Thy reign 
Of everlasting peace; 
Come, take the kingdom to Thyself, 
Great King of righteousness.
