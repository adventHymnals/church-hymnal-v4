1.
'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow 
The star is dimmed that lately shone: 
'Tis midnight; in the garden, now, 
The suffering Savior prays alone. 

2.
'Tis midnight; and from all removed, 
The Saviour wrestles lone with fears; 
E'en that disciple whom He loved 
Heeds not His Master's grief and tears. 

3.
'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt 
The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood; 
Yet He who hath in anguish knelt, 
Is not forsaken by His God. 

4.
'Tis midnight; and from ether plains 
Is borne the song that angels know; 
Unheard by mortals are the strains 
That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.
