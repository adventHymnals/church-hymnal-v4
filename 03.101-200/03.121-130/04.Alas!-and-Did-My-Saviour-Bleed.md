## 124. ALAS! AND DID MY SAVIOUR BLEED?
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Alas! and did my Savior bleed? 
And did my Sovereign die? 
Would He devote that sacred head 
For sinners such as I? 

2.
Was it for crimes that I have done, 
He groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
And love beyond degree! 

3.
Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
And shut its glories in, 
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died 
For man, the creature's sin. 

4.
Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
While His dear cross appears, 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes to tears. 

5.
But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
The debt of love I owe; 
Here, Lord, I give myself away; 
'Tis all that I can do.
