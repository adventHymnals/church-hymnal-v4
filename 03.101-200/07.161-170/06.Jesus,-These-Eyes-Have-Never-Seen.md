####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Jesus, these eyes have never seen, 
That radiant form of Thine; 
The veil of sense hangs dark between 
Thy bless'd face and mine. 

2.
I see Thee not, I hear Thee not, 
Yet art Thou oft with me; 
And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot, 
As where I meet with Thee. 

3.
Like some bright dream that comes unsought, 
When slumbers o'er me roll, 
Thine image ever fills my thought, 
And charms my ravished soul. 

4.
Yet though I have not seen, and still 
Must rest in faith alone, 
I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will, 
Unseen, but not unknown.
