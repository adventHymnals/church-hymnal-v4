Major Key: C

1.
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
That was slain.
CHORUS:
Glory, hallelujah!
Praise Him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah!
To the Lamb!

2.
Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
Now the power of sin consume;
Bring Thy blessed millennium,
Holy Lamb.

3.
Thus may we each moment feel,
Love Him, serve Him, praise Him still,
Till we all on Zion's hill
See the Lamb.
