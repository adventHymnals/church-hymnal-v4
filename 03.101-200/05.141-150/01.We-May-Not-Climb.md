## 141. WE MAY NOT CLIMB
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
We may not climb the heavenly steeps 
To bring the Saviour down; 
In vain we search the lowest deeps, 
For Him no depths can drown. 

2.
But warm, sweet, tender, even yet 
A present help is He; 
And faith has still its Olivet, 
And love its Galilee. 

3.
The healing of the seamless dress 
Is by our beds of pain; 
We touch Him in life's throng and press, 
And we are whole again. 

4.
O Lord and Master of us all, 
Whate'er our name or sign, 
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call, 
We test our lives by Thine!
