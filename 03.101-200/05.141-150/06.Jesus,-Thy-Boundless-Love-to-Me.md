1.
Jesus, Thy boundless love to me 
No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
O knit my thankful heart to Thee, 
And reign without a rival there; 
Thine wholly, Thine alone I am; 
Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame. 

2.
O, grant that nothing in my soul 
May dwell but Thy pure love alone; 
Oh, may Thy love possess me whole, 
My joy, my treasure, and my crown; 
All coldness from my heart remove; 
My every act, word, thought, be love. 

3.
O love, how cheering is thy ray! 
All pain before thy presence flies; 
Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away 
Wherev'er Thy healing beams arise; 
O Jesus, nothing may I see' 
Nothing desire or seek, but Thee. 

4.
In suffering be Thy love my peace, 
In weakness be Thy love my power; 
And when the storms of life shall cease, 
Jesus, in that important hour, 
In death, as life, be Thou my guide, 
And save me, who for me hast died.
