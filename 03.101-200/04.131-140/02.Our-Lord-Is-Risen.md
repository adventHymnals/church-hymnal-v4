## 132. OUR LORD IS RISEN
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Our Lord is risen from the dead; 
Our Jesus is gone up on high! 
A captive host He joyful led, 
To the bright portals of the sky. 

2.
There His triumphal chariot waits, 
And angels chant the solemn lay: 
"Lift up your heads, ye heavenly gates; 
Ye everlasting doors, give way." 

3.
Loose all your bars of golden light, 
And wide unfold the beauteous scene; 
He claims these mansions as His right, 
Receive the King of glory in. 

4.
Who is this King of glory? Who? 
The Lord, that all our foes o'ercame; 
The world, sin, death, and hell o'erthrew; 
And Jesus is the conqueror's name. 

5.
Who is this King of Glory, Who? 
The Lord, of glorious power possessed; 
The King of saints and angels, too; 
God over all, forever blest.
