####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The day of resurrection' 
Earth, tell it out abroad' 
The passover of gladness, 
The passover of God. 
From death to life eternal, 
From this world to the sky, 
Our Christ hath brought us over, 
With hymns of victory. 

2.
Our hearts be pure from evil, 
That we may see aright 
The Lord in rays eternal 
Of resurrection light, 
And, listening to his accents, 
May hear, so calm and plain, 
His own "All hail!" and, hearing, 
May raise the victor strain. 

3.
Now let the heavens be joyful, 
Let earth the song begin, 
Let the round world keep triumph 
And all that is therein; 
Invisible and visible, 
Their notes let all things blend, 
For Christ the Lord hath risen, 
Our joy that hath no end.
