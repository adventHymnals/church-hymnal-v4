#### Advent Hymnals
## 193. THY KINGDOM COME
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Thy kingdom come! on bended knee 
The passing ages pray; 
And faithful souls have yearned to see 
On earth that kingdom's day. 

2.
But the slow watches of the night 
Not less to God belong; 
And for the everlasting right 
The silent stars are strong. 

3.
And lo, already on the hills 
The flags of dawn appear; 
Gird up your loins, ye prophet souls, 
Proclaim the day is near. 

4.
The day in whose clear-shining light 
All wrong shall stand revealed, 
When justice shall be throned in might, 
And every hurt be healed. 

5.
When knowledge, hand in hand with peace, 
Shall walk the earth abroad; 
The day of perfect righteousness, 
The promised day of God.
