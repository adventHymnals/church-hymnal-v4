1.
When the Lord of love was here, 
Happy hearts to Him were dear, 
Though His heart was sad; 
Worn and lonely for our sake, 
Yet he turned aside to make 
All the weary glad. 

2.
Meek and lowly were His ways, 
From His loving grew His praise, 
From His giving, prayer; 
All the outcast thronged to hear, 
All the sorrowful drew near 
To enjoy His care. 

3.
When he walked the fields, He drew 
From the flowers and birds and dew, 
Parables of God; 
For within His heart of love 
All the soul of man did move, 
God had His abode. 

4.
Lord, be ours Thy power to keep 
In the very heart of grief, 
And in trial, love. 
In our meekness to be wise, 
And through sorrows to arise 
To' our God above. 

5.
Fill us with Thy deep desire 
All the sinful to inspire, 
With the Father's life; 
Free us from the cares that press 
On the heart of worldliness 
From the fret and strife.
