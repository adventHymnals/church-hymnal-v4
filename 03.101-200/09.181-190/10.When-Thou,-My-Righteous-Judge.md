####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
When Thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come, 
To call Thy ransomed people home, 
Shall I among them stand? 
Shall such a worthless worm as I, 
Who sometimes am afraid to die, 
Be found at Thy right hand? 
Be found at Thy right hand? 

2.
I love to meet among them now, 
Before Thy gracious throne to bow, 
Though weakest of them all; 
Nor can I bear the piercing thought, 
To have my worthless name left out, 
When Thou for them shalt call, 
When Thou for them shalt call. 

3.
Prevent, prevent it by Thy grace! 
Be Thou, dear Lord, my hiding place 
In that expected day. 
Thy pardoning voice, O let me hear, 
To still each unbelieving fear, 
Nor let me fall, I pray, 
Nor let me fall, I pray. 

4.
Let me among Thy saints be found, 
Whene'er the Archangel's trump shall sound, 
To see Thy smiling face; 
Then joyfully Thy praise I'll sing, 
While heaven's resounding mansions ring 
With shouts of endless grace, 
With shouts of endless grace.
