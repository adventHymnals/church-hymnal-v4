## 047. FORTH IN THY NAME
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Forth in Thy Name, O Lord, I go, 
My daily labor to pursue; 
Thee, only Thee, resolved to know 
In all I think, or speak, or do. 

2.
The task Thy wisdom hath assigned 
O let me cheerfully fulfill; 
In all my works Thy presence find, 
And prove Thy good and perfect will. 

3.
Give me to bear Thy easy yoke, 
And every moment watch and pray; 
And still to things eternal look, 
And hasten to Thy glorious day: 

4.
For Thee delightfully employ 
Whate'er Thy bounteous grace hath given; 
And run my course with even joy, 
And closely walk with Thee to heaven.
