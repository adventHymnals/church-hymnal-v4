#### Advent Hymnals
## 044. AWAKE, MY SOUL
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Awake, my soul, and with the sun 
Thy daily stage of duty run; 
Shake off dull sloth, and early rise 
To pay thy morning sacrifice ! 

2.
Shine on me, Lord; new life impart ! 
Fresh ardors kindle in my heart; 
One ray of Thine all quickening light 
Dispels the clouds and dark of night. 

3.
Direct, control, suggest this day 
All I design, or do, or say, 
That all my power's, with all their might, 
In Thy sole glory may unite. 

4.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; 
Praise him, all creatures here below; 
Praise him above, ye heavenly host; 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
