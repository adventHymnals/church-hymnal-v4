## 080. HOLY AS THOU, O LORD
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Holy as Thou, O Lord, is none; 
Thy holiness is all Thine own; 
A drop of that unbounded sea 
Is ours'a drop derived from Thee. 

2.
And when Thy purity we share, 
Thy brightest glory, we declare; 
And, humbled into nothing, own, 
Most holy, pure is God alone. 

3.
Sole, self-existing God and Lord, 
By all Thy heavenly hosts adored, 
Let all on earth bow down to Thee, 
And own Thy peerless majesty. 

4.
Thy power unparalleled confess, 
Established on the Rock of peace; 
The rock that never shall remove, 
The rock of pure, almighty love.
