## 014. PRAISE YE THE LORD
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Praise ye the Lord! 'tis good to raise 
Your hearts and voices in His praise; 
His nature and His works invite 
To make this duty our delight. 

2.
He formed the stars, those heavenly flames, 
He counts their numbers, calls their names; 
His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound, 
A deep where all our thoughts are drowned. 

3.
Sing to the Lord, exalt Him high, 
Who spreads His clouds along the sky; 
There He prepare the fruitful rain, 
Nor lets the drops descend in vain. 

4.
He makes the grass the hills adorn, 
And clothes the smiling fields with corn; 
The beasts with food His hands supply, 
And the young ravens when they cry. 

5.
His saints are lovely in His sight, 
He views His children with delight; 
He sees their hope, He knows their fear, 
And looks and loves His image there.
