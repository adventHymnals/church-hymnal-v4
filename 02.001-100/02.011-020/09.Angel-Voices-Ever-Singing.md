####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Angel voices ever singing 
Round Thy throne of light; 
Angel harps, forever ringing, 
Rest not day nor night. 
Thousands only live to bless Thee, 
And confess Thee Lord of might. 

2.
Thou who art beyond the farthest 
Mortal eye can scan, 
Can it be that Thou regardest 
Songs of sinful man? 
Can we feel that Thou art near us, 
And wilt hear us? Yea, we can. 

3.
Yea, we know Thy love rejoices 
O'er each work of Thine; 
Thou didst ears and hands and voices 
For Thy praise combine; 
Craftsman's art and music's measure 
For Thy pleasure Didst design. 

4.
Here, great God, today we offer 
Of Thine own to Thee; 
And for Thine acceptance proffer, 
All unworthily, 
Hearts and minds and hands and voices, 
In our choicest Melody.
