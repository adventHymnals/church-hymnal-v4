```txt

1.
Glorious are the lofty mountains 
In the early morning's gleam, 
When the soft glow of the sunshine 
Lights them with its golden beam. 

2.
How those vapors, gently floating, 
Kiss the great snowcrested peaks! 
In the splendor of the mountains 
Our Creator surely speaks. 

3.
Oft of old the psalmist David, 
Playing harp of solemn sound, 
Sung his songs of God's protection 
When he viewed the hills around. 

4.
Sunset rays o'er Judah's mountains 
Touched the clouds with heavenly light 
Till they seemed like hosts of angels 
Sent to guard him through the night. 

5.
Wondrous everlasting mountains! 
Symbols of Jehovah's might! 
There earth reaches up to heaven, 
There heaven first gives earth its light.
