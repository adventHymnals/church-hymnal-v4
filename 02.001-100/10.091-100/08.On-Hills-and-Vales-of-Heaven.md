        Church Hymnal 1941 098. On Hills and Vales of Heaven.  On hills and vales of heaven,  Where falls no shade of gloom,  Where all is peace and glory,  Are wondrous flowers in bloom.  But Thou, oh, Thou art fairer  Than any flower that grows,  Our lily of the valley  And Sharon's fadeless rose.

####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
On hills and vales of heaven, 
Where falls no shade of gloom, 
Where all is peace and glory, 
Are wondrous flowers in bloom. 
But Thou, oh, Thou art fairer 
Than any flower that grows, 
Our lily of the valley 
And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

2.
Within the many mansions 
Are jewels heavenly fair; 
But Thou art far more precious 
Than all the treasures there; 
Most perfect in Thy beauty 
Of all that heaven knows, 
Our pearl of price forever, 
And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

3.
The flowers of earth have perished, 
Its glories all have died; 
For where all joys were transient 
No beauty could abide; 
But Thou art ours forever, 
Where life's bright river flows, 
Our lily of the valley 
And Sharon's fadeless rose.
