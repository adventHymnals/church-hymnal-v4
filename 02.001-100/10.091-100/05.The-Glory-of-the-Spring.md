####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The glory of the spring how sweet, 
The new-born life how glad; 
What joy the happy earth to greet 
In new, bright raiment clad. 
Divine Redeemer, Thee I bless; 
I greet Thy going forth; 
I love Thee in the loveliness 
Of Thy renewed earth. 

2.
But O these wonders of Thy grace, 
These nobler works of Thine, 
These marvels sweeter far to trace, 
These new births more divine. 
This new-born glow of faith so strong, 
This bloom of love so fair, 
This new-born ecstasy of song 
And fragrancy of prayer! 

3.
Creator Spirit, work in me 
These wonders sweet of Thine; 
Divine Redeemer, graciously 
Renew this heart of mine. 
Still let new life and strength upspring, 
Still let new joy be given; 
And grant the glad new song to ring 
Through the new earth and heaven.
