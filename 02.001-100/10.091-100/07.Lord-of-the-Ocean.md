## 097. LORD OF THE OCEAN
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Lord of the ocean vast and deep, 
With sovereign power Thy children keep; 
Thy glorious sun that reigns on high 
Is rivaled by Thy watchful eye. 

2.
Lord of the storm, supreme in power, 
Send forth Thy light in earth's dark hour; 
As flashing lightning speeds through space, 
Advance Thy truth o'er all our race. 

3.
Lord of the bounds of east and west, 
Speed on Thy great millennial rest 
Till saints of every age and clime 
Behold Thy glorious form divine. 

4.
O Sovereign Lord, omniscient, reign 
Supreme o'er all Thy vast domain; 
Let universal voices sing 
Earth's loveliest anthem to her King.
