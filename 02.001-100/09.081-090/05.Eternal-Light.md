#### Advent Hymnals
## 085. ETERNAL LIGHT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Eternal Light! Eternal Light! 
How pure the soul must be 
When, placed within Thy searching sight, 
It shrinks not, but with calm delight 
Can live, and look on Thee! 

2.
The spirits that surround Thy throne 
May bear the burning bliss; 
But surely that is theirs alone, 
Who, undefiled, have never known 
A fallen world like this. 

3.
O how shall I, whose native sphere 
Is dark, whose mind is dim, 
Before the Ineffable appear, 
And on my naked spirit bear 
The uncreated beam? 

4.
There is a way for man to rise 
To that sublime abode: 
An offering and a sacrifice, 
A Holy Spirit's energies, 
An Advocate with God. 

5.
These, these prepare us for the sight 
Of holiness above; 
The sons of ignorance and night, 
May dwell in the eternal Light, 
Through the eternal Love!
