## 081. O GOD, OUR HELP
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
O God, our help in ages past,
our hope for years to come,
our shelter from the stormy blast,
and our eternal home!

2.
Under the shadow of thy throne,
still may we dwell secure;
sufficient is thine arm alone,
and our defense is sure.

3.
Before the hills in order stood,
or earth received her frame,
from everlasting, thou art God,
to endless years the same.

4.
A thousand ages, in thy sight,
are like an evening gone;
short as the watch that ends the night,
before the rising sun.

5.
O God, our help in ages past,
our hope for years to come;
be thou our guide while life shall last,
and our eternal home!
