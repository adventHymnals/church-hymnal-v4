## 087. LEAD US, HEAVENLY FATHER
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us 
O'er the world's tempestuos sea; 
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, 
For we have no help but thee; 
Yet possessing Every blessing 
If our God our Father be. 

2.
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us, 
All our weakness thou dost know; 
Thou didst tread this earth before us, 
Thou didst feel its keenest woe; 
Lone and dreary, Faint and weary, 
Through the desert Thoudidst go. 

3.
Spirit of our God, descending, 
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy; 
Love with every passion blending, 
Pleasure that can never cloy; 
Thus provided, Pardoned, guided, 
Nothing can our peace destroy.
