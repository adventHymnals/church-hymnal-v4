####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
How pleasant, how divinely fair, 
O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! 
With long desire my spirit faints 
To meet th'assemblies of Thy saints. 

2.
Blest are the souls that find a place 
Within the temple of Thy grace; 
There they behold Thy gentle rays, 
And seek Thy face, and learn Thy praise. 

3.
Blest are the men whose hearts are set 
To find the way to Zion's fate. 
God is their strength; and through the road 
They lean upon their helper, God 

4.
Cheerful they walk, with growing strength, 
Till all shall meet in heaven at length, 
Till all before Thy face appear, 
And join in nobler worship there.
