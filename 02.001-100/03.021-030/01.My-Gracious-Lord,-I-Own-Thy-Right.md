## 021. MY GRACIOUS LORD, I OWN THY RIGHT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
My gracious Lord, I own Thy right 
To every service I can pay, 
And call it my supreme delight 
To hear Thy dictates, and obey. 

2.
What is my being but for Thee 
Its sure support, its noblest end? 
'Tis my delight Thy face to see, 
And serve the cause of such a Friend. 

3.
I would not sigh for worldly joy, 
Or to increase my worldly good; 
Nor future days nor powers employ 
To spread a sounding name abroad. 

4.
'Tis to my Saviour I would live 
To Him who for my ransom died; 
Nor could all worldly honor give 
Such bliss as crowns me at His side. 

5.
His work my hoary age shall bless 
When youthful vigeor is no more; 
And my last hour of life confess 
His saving love, His glorious power.
