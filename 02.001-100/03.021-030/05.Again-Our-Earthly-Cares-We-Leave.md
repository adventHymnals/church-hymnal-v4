## 025. AGAIN OUR EARTHLY CARES WE LEAVE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Again our earthly cares we leave, 
And to Thy courts repair; 
Again with joyful feet we taste 
To meet our Saviour there. 

2.
Great Shepherd of Thy people, here 
Thy presence now display. 
We bow within Thy house of prayer; 
O give us hearts to pray! 

3.
The clouds which veil Thee from our sight, 
In pity, Lord, remove; 
Dispose our minds to hear aright 
The message of Thy love. 

4.
The feeling heart, the melting eyes, 
The humble mind, bestow; 
And shine upon us from above, 
To make our graces grow.
