## 037. THE LORD BE WITH US
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The Lord be with us as we bend 
His blessing to receive; 
His gift of peace upon us send 
Before His courts we leave. 

2.
The Lord be with us as we walk 
Along our homeward road; 
In silent thought or friendly talk 
Our hearts be still with God. 

3.
The Lord be with us till the night 
Infold us all to rest; 
Be He of every heart the light, 
Of every home the guest.
