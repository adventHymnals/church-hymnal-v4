1.
Now God be with us, for the night is closing: 
The light and darkness are of His disposing, 
And 'neath His shadow here to rest we yield us, 
For He will shield us. 

2.
Let evil thoughts and spirits flee before us; 
Till morning cometh, watch, O Master, o'er us; 
In soul and body Thou from harm defend us, 
Thine angels send us. 

3.
We have no refuge, none on earth to aid us, 
Save Thee, O Father, who Thine own hast made us; 
But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely 
Who seek Thee only. 

4.
Father, Thy Name be praised, Thy kingdom given, 
Thy will be done on earth as 'tis in Heaven; 
Keep us in life, forgive our sins, deliver 
Us now and ever!
