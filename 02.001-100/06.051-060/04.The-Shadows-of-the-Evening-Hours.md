        Church Hymnal 1941 054. The Shadows of the Evening Hours.  The shadows of the evening hours  Fall from the darkening sky,  Upon the fragrance of the flowers  The dews of evening lie.  Before Thy throne, O Lord of heaven,  We kneel at close of day;  Look on Thy children from on high,  And hear us while we pray.

1.
The shadows of the evening hours 
Fall from the darkening sky, 
Upon the fragrance of the flowers 
The dews of evening lie. 
Before Thy throne, O Lord of heaven, 
We kneel at close of day; 
Look on Thy children from on high, 
And hear us while we pray. 

2.
The sorrows of Thy servants, Lord, 
O do not Thou despise, 
But let the incense of our prayers 
Before Thy mercy rise; 
The brightness of the coming night 
Upon the darkness rolls; 
With hopes of future glory chase 
The shadows on our souls. 

3.
Let peace, O Lord! Thy peace, O God, 
Upon our souls descend; 
From midnight fears, and perils, Thou 
Our trembling hearts defend: 

8.Give us a respite from our toil, 
Calm and subdue our woes; 
Through the long day we labor, Lord, 
O give us now repose.
