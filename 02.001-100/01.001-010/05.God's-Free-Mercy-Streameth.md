####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
God's free mercy streameth 
Over all the world, 
And His banner gleameth, 
By His church unfurled; 
Broad and deep and glorious, 
As the heaven above, 
Shines in might victorious 
His eternal love. 

2.
Summer suns are glowing 
Over land and sea; 
Happy light is flowing, 
Bountiful and free; 
Everything rejoices 
In the mellow rays; 
Earth's ten thousand voices 
Swell the psalm of praise.

3.
Lord, upon our blindness 
Thy pure radiance pour; 
For Thy lovingkindness 
We would love Thee more; 
And when clouds are drifting 
Dark across the sky, 
Then, the veil uplifting, 
Father, be Thou nigh. 

4.
We will never doubt Thee, 
Tho' Thou veil Thy light; 
Life is dark without Thee, 
Death with Thee is bright. 
Light of light, shine o'er us 
On our pilgrim way, 
Go Thou still before us 
To the endless day.
