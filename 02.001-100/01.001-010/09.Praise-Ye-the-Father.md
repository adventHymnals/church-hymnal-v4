```txt
1.
Praise ye the Father for His lovingkindness, 
Tenderly cares He for His erring children; 
Praise Him, ye angels, praise Him in the heavens; 
Praise ye Jehovah!

2.
Praise ye the Saviour, great is His compassion, 
Graciously cares He for His chosen people; 
Young men and maidens, ye old men and children, 
Praise ye the Saviour! 

3.
Praise ye the Spirit, Comforter of Israel, 
Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us; 
Praise ye the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, 
Praise the Eternal Three!
