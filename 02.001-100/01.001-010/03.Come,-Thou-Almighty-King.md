####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Come, Thou almighty King, 
Help us Thy name to sing, 
Help us to praise, 
Father all glorious, 
O'er all victorious, 
Come and reign over us, 
Ancient of days. 

2.
Come, holy Comforter, 
Thy sacred witness bear 
In this glad hour: 
Thou who almighty art, 
Rule now in every heart, 
And ne'er from us depart, 
Spirit of power. 

3.
Thou art the mighty One, 
On earth Thy will be done 
From shore to shore. 
Thy sovereign majesty 
May we in glory see, 
And to eternity 
Love and adore.
