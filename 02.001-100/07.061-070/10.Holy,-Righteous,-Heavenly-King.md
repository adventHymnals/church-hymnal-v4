## 070. HOLY, RIGHTEOUS, HEAVENLY KING
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Holy, righteous, heavenly King, 
Let Thy Holy Spirit bring 
Blessings to us every hour, 
And be governed by its power. 

2.
Let us always think of Thee, 
For Thy blood has made us free; 
Help us, Lord, to do Thy will, 
That Thy Spirit may us fill. 

3.
Fill us with the power divine, 
That, dear Lord, is wholly Thine; 
Sanctify us, Lord, we pray, 
Lead us, guide us, every day.
