## 069. HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
High in the heavens, eternal God, 
Thy goodness in full glory shines; 
Thy truth shall break through every cloud 
That veils and darkens Thy designs. 

2.
Forever firm Thy justice stands, 
As mountains their foundations keep; 
Wise are the wonders of Thy hands; 
Thy judgments are a mighty deep. 

3.
O God! how excellent Thy grace, 
Whence all our hope and comfort spring! 
The sons of Adam in distress 
Fly to the shadow of Thy wings. 

4.
In the provisions of Thy house 
We still shall find a sweet repast; 
There mercy like a river flows, 
And brings salvation to our taste.
