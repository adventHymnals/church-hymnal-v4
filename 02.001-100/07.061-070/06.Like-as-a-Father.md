## 066. LIKE AS A FATHER
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Like as a father pities his child, 
So the Lord pities the sinner defiled; 
Waiteth in kindness, 
Pities our blindness, 
Longeth to welcome, though often reviled. 

2.
Like as a father when we believe, 
Merciful still, He will gladly receive; 
Listens to hear us, 
Blesses to cheer us, 
Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve. 

3.
Like as a father, ever the same, 
He hath created, and knoweth our frame; 
Watcheth the straying, 
Guardeth the praying, 
Bids us to trust in His almighty name. 

4.
Like as a father, constant is He, 
God in compassion regardeth our plea; 
In need He cometh, 
Precious His promise: 
Father in heaven forever to be.
