####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Awake, my soul, in joyful lays, 
And sing thy great Redeemer's praise; 
He justly claims a song from me; 
His lovingkindness, O how free! 
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
His lovingkindness, O how free! 

2.
He saw me ruined in the fall, 
Yet loved me notwithstanding all; 
He saved me from my lost estate; 
His lovingkindness, O how great! 
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
His lovingkindness, O how great! 

3.
Though numerous hosts of mighty foes, 
Though earth and hell my way oppose, 
He safely leads my soul along: 
His lovingkindness, O how strong! 
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
His lovingkindness, O how strong! 

4.
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, 
Has gathered thick and thundered loud, 
He near my soul has always stood: 
His lovingkindness, O how good! 
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
His lovingkindness, O how good! 

5.
And when earth's rightful King shall come 
To take His ransomed people home, 
I'll sing upon that blissful shore 
His lovingkindness, evermore. 
Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
His lovingkindness, evermore.
