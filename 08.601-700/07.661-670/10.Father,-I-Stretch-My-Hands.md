## 670. FATHER, I STRETCH MY HANDS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee; 
No other help I know; 
If Thou withdraw Thyself from me, 
Ah! whither shall I go? 

2.
On Thy dear Son I now believe, 
O let me feel Thy power; 
And all my varied wants relieve, 
In this accepted hour. 

3.
Author of faith! to Thee I lift 
My weary, longing eyes; 
O let me now receive that gift; 
My soul without it dies. 

4.
Surely Thou canst not let me die; 
O speak, and I shall live; 
And here I will unwearied lie, 
Till Thou Thy Spirit give. 

5.
How would my fainting soul rejoice 
Could I but see Thy face! 
Now let me hear Thy quickening voice, 
And taste Thy pardoning grace. 

6.
I do believe, I now believe 
That Jesus died for me, 
And that He shed His precious blood 
From sin to set me free.
