```txt

1.
When all my labors and trials are o'er, 
And I am safe on that beautiful shore, 
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore, 
Will through the ages be glory for me. 
Refrain:
O that will be glory for me, 
Glory for me, glory for me; 
When by His grace I shall look on His face, 
That will be glory, be glory for me. 

2.
When, by the gift of His infinite grace, 
I am accorded in Heaven a place, 
Just to be there and to look on His face, 
Will through the ages be glory for me. 

3.
Friends will be there I have loved long ago; 
Joy like a river around me will flow; 
Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know, 
Will through the ages be glory for me.
