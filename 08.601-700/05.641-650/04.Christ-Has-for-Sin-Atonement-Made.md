1.
Christ has for sin atonement made, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
We are redeemed! the price is paid! 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
Refrain:
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus! 
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord! 

2.
I praise Him for the cleansing blood, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
That reconciled my soul to God; 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

3.
He cleansed my heart from all its sin, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
And now He reigns and rules therein; 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

4.
He walks beside me in the way, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
And keeps me faithful day by day; 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

5.
He gives me overcoming power, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
And triumph in each trying hour; 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

6.
To Him I've given all my heart, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
The world shall never share a part; 
What a wonderful Saviour!
