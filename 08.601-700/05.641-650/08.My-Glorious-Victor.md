## 648. MY GLORIOUS VICTOR
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
My glorious Victor, Prince Divine, 
Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
At length my will is all Thine own, 
Glad vassal of a Saviour's throne. 

2.
My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
Pierce this now willing ear once more. 
Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
With Thee, to toil, endure, obey. 

3.
Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will, 
Use all in Thy dear slavery still! 
Self's weary liberties I cast 
Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast. 

4.
Tread them still down; and then I know 
These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow; 
And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
Which tells me Thou and I are one.
