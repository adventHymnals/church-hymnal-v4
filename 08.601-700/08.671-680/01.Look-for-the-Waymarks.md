        Church Hymnal 1941 671. Look for the Waymarks.  Look for the way-marks as you journey on, Look for the way-marks passing one by one; Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four' Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o'er. CHORUS: Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks, Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four. Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks; The journey's almost o'er.

Major Key: G

1.
Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
Look for the way-marks passing one by one;
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four'
Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o'er.
CHORUS:
Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;
The journey's almost o'er.

2.
First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
Then Medo-Persia's banners were unfurled;
And after Greece held universal sway,
Rome seized the scepter--Where are we today?

3.
Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
What will the next great, glorious drama be?
Christ and His coming, And eternity.
