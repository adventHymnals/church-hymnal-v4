####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Ancient of days, who sittest throned in glory, 
To Thee all knees are bent, all voices pray; 
Thy love has blessed the wide world's wondrous story 
With light and life since Eden's dawning day. 

2.
O Holy Father, who hast led Thy children 
In all the ages, with the fire and cloud, 
Through seas dry shod, through weary wastes bewildering; 
To Thee, in reverent love, our hearts are bowed. 

3.
O Holy Jesus, Prince of Peace and Saviour, 
To Thee we owe the peace that still prevails, 
Stilling the rude wills of men's wild behavior, 
And calming passion's fierce and stormy gales. 

4.
O Holy Ghost, the Lord and the Life giver, 
Thine is the quickening power that gives increase; 
From Thee have flowed, as from a pleasant river, 
Our plenty, wealth, prosperity, and peace. 

5.
O Triune God, with heart and voice adoring, 
Praise we the goodness that doth crown our days; 
Pray we that Thou wilt hear us, still imploring 
Thy love and favor kept to us al ways.
