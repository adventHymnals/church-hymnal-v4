####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
When wilt Thou save the people? 
O God of mercy, when? 
Not kings and lords, but nations! 
Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
Flowers of Thy heart, O God, are they; 
Let them not pass, like weeds, away, 
Their heritage a sunless day. 
God save the people! 

2.
Shall crime bring crime forever, 
Strength aiding still the strong? 
Is it Thy will, O Father, 
That man shall toil for wrong? 
"No," say Thy mountains; "No," Thy skies; 
Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise, 
And songs be heard instead of sighs; 
God save the people! 

3.
When wilt Thou save the people? 
O God of mercy, when? 
The people, Lord, the people, 
Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
God save the people; Thine they are, 
Thy children, as Thy angels fair; 
From vice, oppression, and despair, 
God save the people!
