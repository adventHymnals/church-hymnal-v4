#### Advent Hymnals
## 678. SUNSET AND EVENING STAR
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Sunset and evening star, 
And one clear call for me! 
And may there be no moaning of the bar 
When I put out to sea, 

2.
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, 
Too full for sound and foam, 
When that which drew from out the boundless deep 
Turns again home. 

3.
Twilight and evening bell, 
And after that the dark! 
And may there be no sadness of fare-well 
When I embark; 

4.
For, though from out our bourne of time and place 
The flood may bear me far, 
I hope to see my Pilot face to face 
When I have crossed the bar. 
Amen
