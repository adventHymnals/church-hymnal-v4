```txt

1.
O Jesus, my Redeemer, 
Thou art my joy and song, 
My Saviour and my solace 
When griefs around me throng. 
Refrain:
O Jesus, my Redeemer, 
My song shall be of Thee; 
No other friend so constant, 
No friend so dear to me. 

2.
Thou art my hope and comfort 
Through all the weary years, 
When shadows dark surround me, 
When fall the bitter tears. 

3.
I trust in Thee, my Saviour, 
My faithful Friend and Guide; 
For Thou to me art dearer 
Than all on earth beside. 

4.
My song and my rejoicing 
While in this world of sin, 
My song and my rejoicing 
The heavenly gates within.
