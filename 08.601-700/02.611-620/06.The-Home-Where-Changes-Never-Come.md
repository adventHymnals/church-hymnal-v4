## 616. THE HOME WHERE CHANGES NEVER COME
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The home where changes never come, 
Nor pain nor sorrow, toil nor care; 
Yes! 'tis a bright and blessed home; 
Who would not fain he resting there? 
Refrain:
O wait! meekly wait, and murmur not, 
O wait! meekly wait, and murmur not; 
O wait! 0 wait! O wait! and murmur not. 

2.
Yet when bowed down beneath the load 
By Heaven allowed, thine earthly lot; 
Thou yearnest to reach that blest abode, 
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not. 

3.
If in thy path some thorns are found, 
O, think who bore them on His brow; 
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found, 
It reached a holier than thou. 

4.
Toil on, nor deem, though sore it be, 
One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot; 
The day of rest will dawn for thee! 
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.

```
