        Church Hymnal 1941 618. Sitting at the Feet of Jesus.  Sitting at the feet of Jesus,  O what words I hear Him say!  Happy place! so near, so precious!  May it find me there each day;  Sitting at the feet of Jesus,  I would look upon the past,  For His love has been so gracious,  It has won my heart at last.

####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Sitting at the feet of Jesus, 
O what words I hear Him say! 
Happy place! so near, so precious! 
May it find me there each day; 
Sitting at the feet of Jesus, 
I would look upon the past, 
For His love has been so gracious, 
It has won my heart at last. 

2.
Sitting at the feel of Jesus, 
Where can mortal be more blest? 
There I lay my sins and sorrows, 
And, when weary, find sweet rest; 
Silting at the feet of Jesus, 
There I love to weep and pray, 
While I from His fullness gather 
Grace and comfort every day. 

3.
Bless me, O my Saviour, bless me, 
As I'm waiting at Thy feet, 
O look down in love upon me, 
Let me see Thy face so sweet; 
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus, 
Make me holy as He is, 
May I prove I've been with Jesus, 
Who is all my righteousness.
