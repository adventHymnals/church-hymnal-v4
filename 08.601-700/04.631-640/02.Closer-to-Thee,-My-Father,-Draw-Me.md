## 632. CLOSER TO THEE, MY FATHER, DRAW ME
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
 1.
Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, 
I long for Thine embrace; 
Closer within Thine arms enfold me, 
I seek a resting place. 
Refrain:
Closer with the cords of love, 
Draw me to Thyself above; 
Closer draw me, 
To Thyself above. 

2.
Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me 
Nor let me leave Thee more; 
Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, 
And count my wanderings o'er. 

3.
Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me 
Till I am all like Thee; 
Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, 
Till I am pure and free.
