####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
I'm pressing on the upward way, 
New heights I'm gaining every day; 
Still praying as I onward bound, 
'Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.' 
Refrain:
Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand 
By faith on heaven's tableland; 
A higher plane than I have found; 
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. 

2.
My heart has no desire to stay 
Where doubts arise and fears dismay; 
Though some may dwell where these abound, 
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground. 

3.
I want to live above the world, 
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled; 
For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
The song of saints on higher ground. 

4.
I want to scale the utmost height, 
And catch a gleam of glory bright; 
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found, 
'Lord, lead me on to higher ground.'
