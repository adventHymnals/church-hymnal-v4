1.
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
A wonderful Saviour to me, 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
Where rivers of pleasure I see. 
Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
And covers me there with His hand, 
And covers me there with His hand. 

2.
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
He taketh my burden away; 
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved, 
He giveth me strength as my day. 

3.
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
And, filled with His fulness divine, 
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God, 
For such a Redeemer as mine. 

4.
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
To meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, 
I'll shout with the millions on high.
