## 605. I NEED THEE, PRECIOUS JESUS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
I need Thee precious Jesus, For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
I need the love of Jesus To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps, To be my strength and stay.

2.
I need the heart of Jesus To feel each anxious care,
To tell my every trial, And all my sorrows share. 
I need the Holy Spirit To teach me what I am,
To show me more of Jesus, To point me to the Lamb.

3.
I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with the rainbow, And seated on Thy throne.
There with Thy blood-bought children, My joy shall ever be
To sing Thy ceaseless praises, To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.
