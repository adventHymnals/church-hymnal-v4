```txt
1.
There's sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky, 
For Jesus is my light.
CHORUS:
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
When the peaceful, happy moments roll
When Jesus shows His smiling face 
There is sunshine in the soul.

2.
There's music in my soul today,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus, listening, can hear 
The songs I cannot sing.

3.
There's springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart, 
The flowers of grace appear.

4.
Theres gladness in my soul today, 
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now, 
For joys laid up above.
