####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Jesus, Thou hast promised 
That where two or three 
In Thy name have gathered, 
Thou wilt present be; 
And Thy word believing, 
Now in prayer we kneel; 
Jesus, come and bless us; 
Lord, Thyself reveal. 
Refrain:
Jesus, come and bless us 
While we linger here; 
Jesus, come and bless us, 
Be Thou ever near. 

2.
Jesus, Thou hast met us 
Oft in seasons past, 
But we need Thy presence 
With us till the last; 
Come, O blessed Saviour, 
And Thy grace display; 
Hear us and accept us; 
Bless us while we pray. 

3.
Jesus, tune our voices 
To Thy songs of praise; 
Be in each petition 
That to Thee we raise; 
May our faith grow stronger, 
And our hope more bright; 
May our love be purer, 
And our path more light.
