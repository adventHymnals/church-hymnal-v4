####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Rest There is a place of quiet rest, 
Near to the heart of God, 
A place where sin cannot molest, 
Near to the heart of God. 
Refrain:
O Jesus, blest Redeemer, 
Sent from the heart of God, 
Hold us, who wait before Thee, 
Near to the heart of God. 

2.
There is a place of comfort sweet, 
Near to the heart of God, 
A place where we our Savior meet, 
Near to the heart of God. 

3.
There is a place of full release, 
Near to the heart of God, 
A place where all is joy and peace, 
Near to the heart of God.
