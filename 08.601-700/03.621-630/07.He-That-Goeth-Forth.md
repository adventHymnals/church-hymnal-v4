## 627. HE THAT GOETH FORTH
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
He that goeth forth with weeping,
Bearing precious seed in love, 
Never tiring, never sleeping, 
Findeth mercy from above. 

2.
Soft descend the dews of heaven, 
Bright the rays celestial shine; 
Precious fruits will thus be given, 
Through an influence all divine. 

3.
Sow the seed, be never weary; 
Let no fears thy soul annoy; 
Be the prospect ne'er so dreary, 
Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy. 

4.
Lo, the scene of verdure brightening! 
See the rising grain appear; 
Look again! the fields are whitening, 
For the harvest time is near.
