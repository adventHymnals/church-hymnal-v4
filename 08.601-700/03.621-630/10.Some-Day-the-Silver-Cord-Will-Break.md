```txt

1.
Someday the silver cord will break, 
And I no more as now shall sing; 
But, O, the joy when I shall wake 
Within the palace of the King! 
Refrain:
And I shall see Him face to face, 
And tell the story'Saved by grace; 
And I shall see Him face to face, 
And tell the story'Saved by grace. 

2.
Someday my earthly house will fall, 
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be, 
But this I know'my all in all 
Has now a place in heaven for me. 

3.
Someday, when fades the golden sun 
Beneath the rosy-tinted west, 
My blessed Lord will say, "Well done!" 
And I shall enter into rest.
