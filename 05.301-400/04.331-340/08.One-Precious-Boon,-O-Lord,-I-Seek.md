####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
One precious boon, O Lord, I seek, 
While tossed upon life's billowy sea; 
To hear a voice within me speak, 
"Thy Saviour is well pleased with thee." 

2.
Earth's scoffs and scorn well pleased I'll bear, 
Nor mourn though underfoot I'm trod, 
If day by day I may but share 
Thine approbation, O my God! 

3.
The friends I love may turn from me, 
Their words unkind may pierce me through; 
But this my daily prayer shall be, 
"Forgive; they know not what they do." 

4.
Let me but know, wher-e'er I roam, 
That I am doing Jesus' will; 
And though I've neither friends nor home, 
My heart shall glow with gladness still. 

5.
To that bright, blest, immortal morn, 
By holy prophets long foretold, 
My eager, longing eyes I turn, 
And soon its glories shall behold. 

6.
Then all the scoffs and scorn I've borne 
For His dear sake who died for me, 
To everlasting joys will turn, 
In glorious immortality.
