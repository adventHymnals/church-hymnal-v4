#### Advent Hymnals
## 334. CALM ME, MY GOD
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Calm me, my God, and keep me calm, 
Reclining on Thy breast; 
Soothe me with holy hymn and psalm, 
And bid my spirit rest. 

2.
Yes, keep me calm, though loud and rude 
The sounds my ear that greet, 
Calm in the closet's solitude, 
Calm in the bustling street. 

3.
Calm in the hour of buoyant health, 
Calm in the hour of pain, 
Calm in my poverty or wealth, 
Calm in my loss or gain. 

4.
Calm in the sufferance of wrong, 
Like Him who bore my shame; 
Calm 'mid the threatening, taunting throng. 
Who hate Thy holy name. 

5.
Calm as the ray of sun or star, 
Which storms assail in vain, 
Moving unruffled through earth's war, 
Th' eternal calm to gain.
