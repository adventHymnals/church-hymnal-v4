#### Advent Hymnals
## 347. WORK WHILE IT IS TODAY
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Work while it is today! 
This was our Saviour's rule; 
With docile minds let us obey, 
As learners in His school. 

2.
Lord Christ, we humbly ask 
Of Thee the power and will, 
With fear and meekness, every task 
Of duty to fulfil. 

3.
At home, by word and deed, 
Adorn redeeming grace; 
And sow abroad the precious seed 
Of truth in every place' 

4.
That thus the wilderness 
May blossom like the rose, 
And trees spring up of righteousness, 
Where'er life's river flows.

```
