####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
In the heart of Jesus there is love for you, 
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true; 
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh, 
When the heart of Jesus has a full supply? 

2.
In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you, 
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew; 
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought, 
Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought? 

3.
In the field of Jesus there is work for you; 
Such as even angels might rejoice to do; 
Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand, 
While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand? 

4.
In the home of Jesus there's a place for you; 
Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too; 
Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace, 
If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?
