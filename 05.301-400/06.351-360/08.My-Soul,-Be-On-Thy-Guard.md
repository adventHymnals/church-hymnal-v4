## 358. MY SOUL, BE ON THY GUARD
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
Major Key: B Flat

1.
My soul, be on thy guard!
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

2.
O watch, and fight, and pray!
The battle ne'er give o'er;
Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.

3.
Ne'er think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
Thy arduous task will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.

```
