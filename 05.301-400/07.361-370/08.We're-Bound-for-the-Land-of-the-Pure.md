```txt

1.
We're bound for the land of the pure and the holy, 
The home of the happy, the kingdom of love; 
Ye wanderers from God, in the broad road of folly, 
O say, will you go to the Eden above? 
Refrain:
Will you go, will you go, will you go, will you go? 
O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

2.
In that blessed land, neither sighing nor anguish 
Can breathe in the fields where the glorified rove; 
Ye heart-burdened ones, who in misery languish 
O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

3.
Nor fraud, nor deceit, nor the hand of oppression, 
Can injure the dwellers in that holy grove; 
No wickedness there, not a shade of transgression; 
O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

4.
No poverty there, no, the saints are all wealthy, 
The heirs of His glory whose nature is love; 
No sickness can reach them, that country is healthy; 
O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

5.
And yet, guilty sinner, we would not forsake thee, 
We halt yet a moment as onward we move; 
O, come to thy Lord! in His arms He will take thee, 
And bear thee along to the Eden above.
