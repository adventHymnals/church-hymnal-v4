        Church Hymnal 1941 373. Pilgrims On, the Day Is Dawning.  Pilgrims, on! the day is dawning;  Strike your tents, and homeward haste;  Sleep not while the blush or morning  Calls ou on the desert waste.  Though the way be dark and dreary,  Life's sharp anguish must be borne;  Courage, then, ye faint and weary,  Linger not to weep and mourn.

1.
Pilgrims, on! the day is dawning; 
Strike your tents, and homeward haste; 
Sleep not while the blush or morning 
Calls ou on the desert waste. 
Though the way be dark and dreary, 
Life's sharp anguish must be borne; 
Courage, then, ye faint and weary, 
Linger not to weep and mourn. 

2.
Pilgrims, on! the storm is beating, 
Beating wildly on your way; 
Tarry not, the time is fleeting; 
Shall the storm your foot-steps stay? 
Hasten on, through joy and sorrow, 
Or whatever may betide, 
Wait not for the calm tomorow, 
Faithful at your work abide. 

3.
Pilgrims, on! what though in dangers, 
Life's eventful course pursue; 
Labor on, ye friendless strangers, 
Grace will guide you safely through. 
What if trials must befall you! 
What if fierce temptations rise! 
Shall earth's bitter strife appall you 
While contending for the prize? 

4.
Pilgrims, on! there's rest in heaven, 
Rest from every anxious care, 
Rest in Jesus' smiles, forgiven, 
Peaceful and eternal there. 
O, 'twere sweet to toil in sadness, 
O, 'twere well the cross to bear, 
If, at last in joy or gladness, 
We may rest forever there!
