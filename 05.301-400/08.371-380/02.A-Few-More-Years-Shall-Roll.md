1.
A few more years shall roll, 
A few more seasons come, 
And we shall meet the loved who now 
Are sleeping in the tomb. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 
My soul for that great day; 
O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away! 

2.
A few more storms shall beat 
On this wild, rocky shore, 
And we shall be where tempests cease, 
And surges swell no more. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 
My soul for that calm day; 
O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away! 

3.
A few more struggles here, 
A few more partings sore, 
A few more toils, a few more tears, 
And we shall weep no more. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 
My soul for that blest day; 
O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away! 

4.
'Tis but a little while, 
And He shall come again, 
Who died that we might live, who lives 
That we may with Him reign. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 
My soul for that glad day; 
O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away!
