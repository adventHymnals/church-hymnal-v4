#### Advent Hymnals
## 379. THE IS A BLESSED HOPE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
There is a blessed hope, 
More precious and more bright 
Than all the joyless mockery 
The world esteems delight. 

2.
There is a lovely star 
That lights the darkest gloom, 
And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er 
The prospects of the tomb. 

3.
There is a cheering voice 
That lifts the soul above, 
Dispels the painful, anxious doubt, 
And whispers, "God is love," 

4.
That voice from Calvary's height 
Proclaims the forgiven; 
That star is revelation's light, 
That hope, the hope of heaven.
