## 301. THERE IS A HAPPY LAND
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
There is a happy land, 
Far, far away, 
Where saints in glory stand, 
Bright, bright as day. 
O! how they sweetly sing, 
"Worthy is our Saviour King;" 
Loud let His praises ring, 
Praise, praise for aye. 

2.
Come to that happy land 
Come, come away; 
Why will ye doubting stand? 
Why still delay? 
O! we shall happy be, 
From all sin and sorrow free; 
Lord, we shall live with Thee, 
Blest, blest for aye. 

3.
Bright in that happy land 
Beams every eye; 
Kept by a Father's hand, 
Love cannot die; 
Then shall Thy kingdom come, 
Saints have a glorious home; 
And, brighter than the sun, 
Reign, reign for aye.
