## 391. SHEPHERD DIVINE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Shepherd divine, Thou leadest me 
Where the still waters gently flow; 
In pastures fair Thou feedest me; 
I trust Thy love, no want I know. 

2.
In danger's hour Thou hidest me, 
Safe from the foe of Thy dear flock; 
At sultry noon Thou guidest me, 
To rest beside the cooling rock. 

3.
When chilling dews of evening fall, 
Then to the fold Thou bidst me come; 
Gladly I hasten at Thy call; 
Sweet is the voice that calls me home.
