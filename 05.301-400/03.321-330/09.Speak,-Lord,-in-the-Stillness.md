## 329. SPEAK, LORD, IN THE STILLNESS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Speak, Lord, in the stillness, 
While I wait on Thee; 
Hushed my heart to listen, 
In expectancy. 

2.
Speak, O blessed Master, 
In this quiet hour; 
Let me see Thy face, Lord, 
Feel Thy touch of power. 

3.
For the words Thou speakest, 
"They are life" indeed; 
Living bread from heaven, 
Now my spirit feed! 

4.
All to Thee is yielded, 
I am not my own; 
Blissful, glad surrender, 
I am Thine alone. 

5.
Speak, Thy servant heareth, 
Be not silent, Lord; 
Waits my soul upon Thee 
For the quickening word! 

6.
Fill me with the knowledge 
Of Thy glorious will; 
All Thine own good pleasure 
In Thy child fulfill. 

7.
Like "a watered garden," 
Full of fragrance rare, 
Lingering in Thy presence, 
Let my life appear.

```
