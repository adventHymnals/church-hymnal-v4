#### Advent Hymnals
## 322. O, COULD I FIND FROM DAY TO DAY
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
O, could I find, from day to day, 
A nearness to my God, 
Then would my hours glide sweet away. 
While leaning on His word. 

2.
Lord, I desire with Thee to live 
Anew from day to day, 
In joys the world can never give, 
Nor ever take away. 

3.
Blest Jesus, come, and rule my heart, 
And make me wholly Thine, 
That I may nevermore depart, 
Nor grieve Thy love divine.

```
