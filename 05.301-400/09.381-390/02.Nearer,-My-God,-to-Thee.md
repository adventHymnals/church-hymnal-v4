Major Key: F

1.
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee! 
E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee; 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! 

2.
Though like the wanderer, The sun gone down, 
Darkness be over me, My rest a stone; 
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee; 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee! 

3.
There let the way appear, Steps unto heaven; 
All that Thou sendest me, In mercy given; 
Angels to beckon me 
Nearer, my God, to Thee; 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee! 

4.
Then, with my waking thoughts Bright with Thy praise, 
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be 
Nearer, my God, to Thee; 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee! 

5.
Or if, on joyful wing Cleaving the sky, 
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Upward I fly, 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee; 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!
