Major Key: G

1.
More love to Thee, O Christ, More love to Thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

2.
Once earthly joy I craved, Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek, Give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

3.
Let sorrow do its work, Send grief or pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers, Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

4.
Then shall my latest breath Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, More love to Thee!
