#### Advent Hymnals
## 318. COME, MY SOUL
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Come, my soul, thy suit prepare! 
Jesus loves to answer prayer; 
He Himself has bid thee pray, 
Therefore will not say thee nay. 

2.
With my burden I begin: 
Lord, remove this load of sin; 
Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt, 
Set my conscience free from guilt. 

3.
Lord, I come to Thee for rest, 
Take possession of my breast: 
There, Thy sovereign right maintain, 
And without a rival reign.

```
