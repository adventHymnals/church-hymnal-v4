####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
Unuttered or expressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small; 
For the dear God who loveth us, 
He made and loveth all. 

2.
Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 
The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye 
When none but God is near. 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small; 
For the dear God who loveth us, 
He made and loveth all. 

3.
Prayer is the simplest form of speech 
That infant lips can try; 
Prayer the sublimest strains that reach 
The Majesty on high. 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small; 
For the dear God who loveth us, 
He made and loveth all. 

4.
Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 
The Christian's native air, 
His watchword at the gates of death; 
He enters heaven with prayer. 
O Thou, by whom we come to God, 
The life, the truth, the way, 
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod; 
Lord, teach us how to pray.
