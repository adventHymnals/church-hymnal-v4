## 315. STILL WITH THEE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1. 
Still with Thee, O my God! 
I would desire to be; 
By day, by night, at home, abroad, 
I would be still with Thee. 

2.
With Thee when dawn comes in, 
And calls me back to care; 
Each day returning to begin 
With Thee, my God, in prayer. 

3.
With Thee when day is done, 
And evening calms the mind; 
The setting, as the rising sun, 
With Thee my heart would find. 

4.
With Thee, in Thee, by faith 
Abiding I would be; 
By day, by night, in life, in death, 
I would be still with Thee.
