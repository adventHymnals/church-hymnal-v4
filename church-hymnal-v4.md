[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXNUZcHNa98HeYDQQYe1fsglr39WRh6x/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Before Jehovah's awful throne, 
    Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; 
    Know that the Lord is God alone; 
    He can create, and He destroy. 

    2.
    His sovereign power, without our aid, 
    Made us of clay, and formed us men; 
    And when like wandering sheep we strayed, 
    He brought us to His fold again.

    3.
    We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs, 
    High as the heavens our voices raise; 
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, 
    Shall fill His courts with sounding praise. 

    4.
    Wide as the world is His command, 
    Vast as Eternity His love; 
    Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, 
    When rolling years shall cease to move.
 
 

## 2.  From All That Dwell Below the Skies

    1.
    From all that dwell below the skies 
    Let the Creator's praise arise; 
    Let His almighty name be sung 
    Through every land, by every tongue.

    2.
    Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord, 
    Eternal truth attends Thy word; 
    Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
    Till suns shall rise and set no more. 

    3.
    Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring, 
    In songs of praise divinely sing; 
    God's great salvation loud proclaim, 
    And shout for joy His glorious name.

    4.
    In every land begin the song, 
    To every land the strains belong; 
    In cheerful sounds all voices raise, 
    And fill the world with loudest praise.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NrULZGK7ZCHxcAZqD7xAFPE%2DY_XDUpHk/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, Thou almighty King, 
    Help us Thy name to sing, 
    Help us to praise, 
    Father all glorious, 
    O'er all victorious, 
    Come and reign over us, 
    Ancient of days. 

    2.
    Come, holy Comforter, 
    Thy sacred witness bear 
    In this glad hour: 
    Thou who almighty art, 
    Rule now in every heart, 
    And ne'er from us depart, 
    Spirit of power. 

    3.
    Thou art the mighty One, 
    On earth Thy will be done 
    From shore to shore. 
    Thy sovereign majesty 
    May we in glory see, 
    And to eternity 
    Love and adore.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcNxCjaZXyn1WEk8ZqsMXijkI3q_Z4QQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With reverence let the saints appear, 
    And bow before the Lord; 
    His high commands with reverence hear, 
    And tremble at His word; 
    And tremble at His word.

    2.
    How terrible Thy glories be! 
    How bright Thine armies shine! 
    Where is the power that vies with Thee, 
    Or truth compared with Thine? 
    Or truth compared with Thine? 

    3.
    Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord, 
    Your great Deliverer sing; 
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound, 
    Be joyful in your King; 
    Be joyful in your King. 

    4.
    O Jesus, Lord of earth and heaven, 
    Our life and joy, to Thee 
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing given 
    Through all eternity; 
    Through all eternity.
 
 

## 5.  'God''s Free Mercy Streameth'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxuPtORGC3C0PdnPt9H5eNjcYNjBSsmj/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God's free mercy streameth 
    Over all the world, 
    And His banner gleameth, 
    By His church unfurled; 
    Broad and deep and glorious, 
    As the heaven above, 
    Shines in might victorious 
    His eternal love. 

    2.
    Summer suns are glowing 
    Over land and sea; 
    Happy light is flowing, 
    Bountiful and free; 
    Everything rejoices 
    In the mellow rays; 
    Earth's ten thousand voices 
    Swell the psalm of praise.

    3.
    Lord, upon our blindness 
    Thy pure radiance pour; 
    For Thy lovingkindness 
    We would love Thee more; 
    And when clouds are drifting 
    Dark across the sky, 
    Then, the veil uplifting, 
    Father, be Thou nigh. 

    4.
    We will never doubt Thee, 
    Tho' Thou veil Thy light; 
    Life is dark without Thee, 
    Death with Thee is bright. 
    Light of light, shine o'er us 
    On our pilgrim way, 
    Go Thou still before us 
    To the endless day.
 
 

## 6.  O Worship the Lord
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORfMgsASI2yXJTFW%2DB2TE2_jS_NCYGbf/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
    Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
    With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,
    Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.

    2.
    Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,
    High on His heart He will bear it for thee,
    Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,
    Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.

    3.
    Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness
    Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;
    Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,
    These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.

    4.
    These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
    He will accept for the name that is dear;
    Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
    Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.
 
 

## 7.  The Lord in Zion Reigneth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NfulVsSV%2DDG0d9VrYvsv6fD4Cf90p_oP/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,
    And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;
    The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,
    To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.

    2.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?
    The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.
    O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,
    Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.

    3.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;
    O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;
    Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,
    Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.
 
 

## 8.  We Gather Together
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0fbRwAtrSK9Szci33sLXkPIHV5chvvL/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;
    He chastens and hastens His will to make known.
    The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.
    Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.

    2.
    Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
    Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
    So from the beginning the fight we were winning;
    Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!

    3.
    We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant,
    And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be.
    Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;
    Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!

    Shining with her gentle light. 

    3.
    Praise Him for our harvest store; 
    He hath filled the garner floor; 
    And for richer food than this, 
    Pledge of everlasting bliss.

    1.
    The Lord Jehovah reigns, 
    His throne is built on high;

    Are light and majesty. 
    His glories shine with beams so bright 
    No mortal eye can bear the sight. 

    2.
    The thunders of His hand

    And where His love resolves to bless, 
    His truth confirms and seals the grace. 

    3.
    Through all His mighty works 
    Amazing wisdom shines; 
    Confounds the powers of hell, 
    And all their designs. 
    Strong is His arm, and shall fulfill 
    His great decrees and sovereign will. 

    4.
    And will this sovereign King 
    Of glory condescend, 
    And will He write His name 
    My father and my Friend? 
    I love His name, I love His word; 
    Join all my powers to praise the Lord!

    If with His love He befriend thee.

    All people that on earth do dwell,
    sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
    Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;
    come ye before him and rejoice.

    2.
    Know that the Lord is God indeed;
    without our aid he did us make;
    we are his folk, he doth us feed,
    and for his sheep he doth us take.

    3.
    O enter then his gates with praise;
    approach with joy his courts unto;
    praise, laud, and bless his name always,

    Praise ye the Lord! 'tis good to raise 
    Your hearts and voices in His praise; 
    His nature and His works invite 
    To make this duty our delight. 

    2.
    He formed the stars, those heavenly flames, 
    He counts their numbers, calls their names; 
    His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound, 
    A deep where all our thoughts are drowned. 

    3.
    Sing to the Lord, exalt Him high, 
    Who spreads His clouds along the sky; 
    There He prepare the fruitful rain, 
    Nor lets the drops descend in vain. 

    4.
    He makes the grass the hills adorn, 
    And clothes the smiling fields with corn; 
    The beasts with food His hands supply, 
    And the young ravens when they cry. 

    5.
    His saints are lovely in His sight, 
    He views His children with delight; 
    He sees their hope, He knows their fear, 
    And looks and loves His image there.

    A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
    My dear Redeemer's throne,
    Where only Christ is heard to speak,
    Where Jesus reigns alone.

    3.
    A heart in every thought renewed
    And full of love divine,
    Perfect and right and pure and good,
    A copy, Lord, of Thine.

    1.
    Angel voices ever singing 
    Round Thy throne of light; 
    Angel harps, forever ringing, 
    Rest not day nor night. 
    Thousands only live to bless Thee, 
    And confess Thee Lord of might. 

    2.
    Thou who art beyond the farthest 
    Mortal eye can scan, 
    Can it be that Thou regardest 
    Songs of sinful man? 
    Can we feel that Thou art near us, 
    And wilt hear us? Yea, we can. 

    3.
    Yea, we know Thy love rejoices 
    O'er each work of Thine; 
    Thou didst ears and hands and voices 
    For Thy praise combine; 
    Craftsman's art and music's measure 
    For Thy pleasure Didst design. 

    4.
    Here, great God, today we offer 
    Of Thine own to Thee; 
    And for Thine acceptance proffer, 
    All unworthily, 
    Hearts and minds and hands and voices,

    1.
    Lord of all being, throned afar,
    Thy glory flames from sun and star;
    Center and soul of every sphere
    Yet to each loving heart how near!
    Yet to each loving heart how near!

    2.
    Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray
    Shed on our path the glow of day;
    Star of our hope, Thy softened light
    Cheers the long watches of the night,
    Cheers the long watches of the night.

    3.
    Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;
    Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;
    Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign;
    All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,
    All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

    4.
    Lord of all life, below, above
    Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
    Before Thy ever-blazing throne
    We ask no luster of our own,
    We ask no luster of our own.

    5.
    Grant us Thy truth to make us free
    And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;

    My gracious Lord, I own Thy right 
    To every service I can pay, 
    And call it my supreme delight

    2.
    What is my being but for Thee 
    Its sure support, its noblest end? 
    'Tis my delight Thy face to see, 
    And serve the cause of such a Friend. 

    3.
    I would not sigh for worldly joy, 
    Or to increase my worldly good; 
    Nor future days nor powers employ 
    To spread a sounding name abroad. 

    4.
    'Tis to my Saviour I would live 
    To Him who for my ransom died; 
    Nor could all worldly honor give 
    Such bliss as crowns me at His side. 

    5.
    His work my hoary age shall bless 
    When youthful vigeor is no more; 
    And my last hour of life confess 
    His saving love, His glorious power.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rz5UPwyRRO4Z%2D888Iov3m%2DxVFbaNNgle/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Lord, with glowing heart I'd praise Thee 
    For the bliss Thy love bestows; 
    For the pardoning grace that saves me, 
    And the peace that from it flows: 
    Help, O God, my weak endeavor: 
    This dull soul to rapture raise; 
    Thou must light the flame, or never 
    Can my soul be warmed to praise. 

    2.
    Praise, my soul, the God that sought thee, 
    Wretched wanderer, far astray; 
    Found thee lost, and kindly brought thee 
    From the paths of death away. 
    Praise, with love's devoutest feeling, 
    Him who saw they guiltborn fear, 
    And, the light of hope revealing, 
    Bade the bloodstained cross appear. 

    3.
    Lord, this bossom's ardent feeling 
    Vainly would my lips express. 
    Low before Thy footstool kneeling, 
    Deign Thy suppliant's prayer to bless; 
    Let Thy grace, my soul's chief treasure, 
    Love's pure flame within me raise; 
    And, since words can never measure, 
    Let my life show forth Thy praise.

    1.
    How pleasant, how divinely fair, 
    O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! 
    With long desire my spirit faints 
    To meet th'assemblies of Thy saints. 

    2.
    Blest are the souls that find a place 
    Within the temple of Thy grace; 
    There they behold Thy gentle rays, 
    And seek Thy face, and learn Thy praise. 

    3.
    Blest are the men whose hearts are set 
    To find the way to Zion's fate. 
    God is their strength; and through the road 
    They lean upon their helper, God 

    4.
    Cheerful they walk, with growing strength, 
    Till all shall meet in heaven at length, 
    Till all before Thy face appear, 
    And join in nobler worship there.

    O give us hearts to pray! 

    3.
    The clouds which veil Thee from our sight, 
    In pity, Lord, remove; 
    Dispose our minds to hear aright 
    The message of Thy love. 

    4.
    The feeling heart, the melting eyes, 
    The humble mind, bestow; 
    And shine upon us from above, 
    To make our graces grow.
 
 

## 26.  Again We Meet
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3uybstEbOatTo7jl3isZTGnU%2DMRl1Xi/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Father, again in Jesus' name we meet, 
    And bow in penitence beneath Thy feet; 
    Again to Thee our grateful voices raise, 
    To sue for mercy, and to sing Thy praise. 

    2.
    O we would bless Thee for Thy ceaseless care, 
    And all Thy love from day to day declare! 
    Is not our life with hourly mercies crowned? 
    Does not Thine arm encircle us around? 

    3.
    Alas! unworthy of Thy boundless love, 
    Too oft with careless feet from Thee we rove; 
    But now, encouraged by Thy voice, we come, 
    Returning sinners, to a Father's home. 

    4.
    O by that name in which all fullness dwells, 
    O by that love which every love excels, 
    O by that blood so freely shed for sin, 
    Open blessed mercy's gate, and take us in.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S6Uop9w5bvcz9Ocmk%2DV4nazx9vrlvm1Y/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Blessed Jesus, at Thy word,
    We have gathered all to hear Thee;
    By Thy word our hearts were stirred,
    Now to seek and love and fear Thee.
    By Thy teachings sweet and holy,
    Let us learn to love Thee solely.

    2.
    All our knowledge, sense, and sight,
    Lie in deepest darkness shrouded;
    Till Thy Spirit breaks our night,
    With His beams of truth unclouded.
    He alone to God canst win us,
    He who works all good within us.

    3.
    Glorious Lord, Thy self impart!
    Light of light, from God proceeding.
    Open Thou our ears and heart
    Help us, by Thy Spirit's pleading.
    Hear the cry Thy people raises!
    Hear, and bless our prayer and praises!
 
 

## 28.  Blest Hour When Mortal Man Retires
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RzPtmvw6ZYuTpnEtMo8q%2D1r3ZnYGBIN4/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Blest hour when mortal man retires 
    To hold communion with his God, 
    To send to heaven his warm desires, 
    And listen to the sacred word. 

    2.
    Blest hour when earthly cares resign 
    Their empire o'er his anxious breast; 
    While all around, the calm divine 
    Proclaims the holy day of rest. 

    3.
    Blest hour when God Himself draws nigh, 
    Well pleased His people's voice to hear, 
    To hush the penitential sigh, 
    And wipe away the mourner's tear. 

    4.
    Blest hour! for where the Lord resorts 
    Foretastes of future bliss are given; 
    And mortals find His earthly courts 
    The house of God, the gate of heaven.
 
 

## 29.  We Would See Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SN5aUs6WRWHCj2rFgmue4oTs7T%2DEzJnZ/edit?mode=html)



    Major Key: E Flat

    1.
    We would see Jesus; for the shadows lengthen
    Across the little landscape of our life;
    We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
    For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.

    2.
    We would see Jesus, Rock of our salvation,
    Whereon our feet were set with sovereign grace;
    Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
    Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.

    3.
    We would see Jesus; other lights are paling,
    Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
    The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
    We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

    4.
    We would see Jesus; this is all we're needing-
    Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;
    We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
    Soon to return and end this mortal night!

    1.
    Lord, we come before Thee now, 
    At Thy feet we humbly bow; 
    O do not our suit disdain! 
    Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain? 
    Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain? 

    2.
    Lord, on Thee our souls depend; 
    In compassion now descend, 
    Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace, 
    Tune our lips to sing Thy praise, 
    Tune our lips to sing Thy praise. 

    3.
    Send some message from Thy word 
    That may joy and peace afford; 
    Let Thy Spirit now impart 
    Full salvation to each heart, 
    Full salvation to each heart. 

    4.
    Comfort those who weep and mourn, 
    Let the time of joy return; 
    Those that are cast down lift up, 
    Make them strong in faith and hope, 
    Make them strong in faith and hope. 

    5.
    Grant that all may seek, and find 
    Thee a God supremely kind; 
    Heal the sick, the captive free; 
    Let us all rejoice in Thee, 
    Let us all rejoice in Thee.

    Creator of the universe, 
    Pour out Thy Spirit from above, 
    As from Thy temple we disperse.

    3.

    Our guide and guard forever be; 
    In Thine eternal arms of might 
    Enfold and draw us nearer Thee.

    2.
    Peace to our brethren give;

    In faith and patience may we live, 
    And seek our rest above. 

    3.
    Through changes, bright or drear,

    And toil to spread Thy kingdom here 
    Till we its glory view.

    to the truth may we be found.

    1.
    Saviour, again to Thy dear name we raise 
    With one accord our parting hymn of praise. 
    We stand to bless Thee ere our worship cease, 
    Then, lowly kneeling, wait Thy word of peace. 

    2.
    Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way; 
    With Thee began, with Thee shall end, the day. 
    Guard Thou the lips from sin, the heart from shame, 
    That in this house have called upon Thy name. 

    3.
    Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life, 
    Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife. 
    Then when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease, 
    Call us, O Lord, to Thine eternal peace!

    God be with you till we meet again;
    When life's perils thick confound you;
    Put His arms unfailing round you;
    God be with you till we meet again.

    4.
    God be with you till we meet again;
    Keep love's banner floating over you,
    Strike death's threatening wave before you;
    God be with you till we meet again.
 
 

## 36.  Thy Voice Hath Spoken
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OrnfeG95br9Iah6qWRuWA3JMi%2DiZqjn3/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Thy voice hath spoken, souls have heard; 
    Thy wondrous love hath been declared; 
    Now in this quiet hour 
    Conviction's arrows deeper press, 
    Convince of sin and righteousness, 
    Show forth Thy mighty power. 

    2.
    Thy hand hath torn the veil aside; 
    The secret sin man fain would hide 
    Stands clear beneath Thy gaze. 
    Help now, dear Lord, each wavering heart 
    To turn from sin, from evil part; 
    Make this a day of days. 

    3.
    Defeat the enemy, that he 
    No longer in captivity 
    These bloodbought souls shall bind. 
    Grant that the weary, sinsick one, 
    Whom none can heal but Thou alone, 
    Shall full salvation find. 

    4.
    Bid chains be broken, fetters yield, 
    Let wounds incurable be healed, 
    Set longing captives free; 
    Hearts long defiled cleanse thro' and thro', 
    Deep in the inward part make true, 
    In love and purity. 

    5.
    Speak now, O Lord, Thy strong "I will," 
    The waves of doubt and sorrow still, 
    And bid the struggling cease, 
    That yielded lives possessed by Thee 
    Henceforth Thy witnesses shall be, 
    Kept in Thy perfect peace.

    His gift of peace upon us send 
    Before His courts we leave. 

    2.
    The Lord be with us as we walk 
    Along our homeward road; 
    In silent thought or friendly talk

    The Lord be with us till the night 
    Infold us all to rest; 
    Be He of every heart the light,

    'Mizpah' our parting sweet, 
    'Mizpah' our hearts repeat, 
    Till we again shall meet with songs of praise. 

    2.
    How good to be where God's children meet, 
    How good to worship at Jesus' feet; 
    There love and peace abide, 
    There sweetest rest beside, 
    There every care we hide in joy complete. 

    3.
    Here in His word sweet manna is found, 
    Here living waters for all abound; 
    Jesus our need supplies, 
    And who on Him relies 
    He ever satisfies; 
    His praise resound.

    1.
    Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
    My voice ascending high;
    To Thee will I direct my prayer,
    To Thee lift up mine eye-

    2.
    Up to the hills where Christ is gone
    To plead for all His saints,
    Presenting at His Father's throne
    Our songs and our complaints.

    3.
    O may Thy Spirit guide my feet
    In ways of righteousness;
    Make every path of duty straight
    And plain before my face.

    4.The men that love and fear Thy name
    Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
    The mighty God will compass them
    With favor as a shield.
 
 

## 40.  Sweetly the Holy Hymn
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Of_TxBqOzjQ0Da1jXxYOVncvQAO4oJsP/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Sweetly the holy hymn 
    Breaks on the morning air; 
    Before the world with smoke is dim 
    We meet to offer prayer. 

    2.
    While flowers are wet with dews, 
    Dew of our souls, descend; 
    Ere yet the sun the day renews, 
    O Lord, Thy Spirit send. 

    3.
    Upon the battlefield, 
    Before the fight begins, 
    We seek, O Lord, Thy sheltering shield, 
    To guard us from our sins. 

    4.
    On the lone mountainside, 
    Before the morning's light, 
    The Man of Sorrows wept and cried, 
    And rose refreshed with might. 

    5.
    Oh, hear us, then, for we 
    Are very weak and frail; 
    We make the Saviour's name our plea, 
    And surely, must prevail.

    O Christ, with each returning morn 
    Thine image to our hearts be borne; 
    And may we ever clearly see 
    Our dearest treasure, Lord, in Thee ! 

    2.
    All hallowed be our walk this day; 
    May meekness form our morning ray, 
    And faithful love our noontide light, 
    And hope our sunset, calm and bright. 

    3.
    May grace each idle thought control, 
    And sanctify each wayward soul; 
    May guile depart, and malice cease, 
    And all within be joy and peace.
 
 

## 42.  New Every Morning
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0jggWVqFf1R7hmsYEuV9QzpvL9LI6iN/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    New every morning is the love 
    Our wakening and uprising prove; 
    Through sleep and darkness safely brought, 
    Restored to life, and power, and thought. 

    2.
    New mercies, each returning day, 
    Hover around us while we pray; 
    New perils past, new sins forgiven, 
    New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven. 

    3.
    If on our daily course our mind 
    Be set to hallow all we find, 
    New treasures still, of countless price, 
    God will provide for sacrifice. 

    4.
    The trivial round, the common task, 
    Will furnish all we need to ask; 
    Room to deny ourselves; a road 
    To bring us daily nearer God. 

    5.
    Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love, 
    Fit us for perfect rest above; 
    And help us, this and every day, 
    To live more nearly as we pray.

    When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries,
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

    2.
    Whene'er the sweet church bell peals over hill and dell,
    May Jesus Christ praised!
    O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings,
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

    3.
    The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!
    The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

    4.
    Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find,
    May Jesus Christ praised!
    Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound,
    May Jesus Christ praised!

    5.
    In heaven's eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this,
    May Jesus Christ praised!
    Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,
    May Jesus Christ praised!

    6.

    Be this th'eternal song through all the ages long,
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

    Thy daily stage of duty run; 
    Shake off dull sloth, and early rise 
    To pay thy morning sacrifice ! 

    2.
    Shine on me, Lord; new life impart ! 
    Fresh ardors kindle in my heart; 
    One ray of Thine all quickening light 
    Dispels the clouds and dark of night. 

    3.
    Direct, control, suggest this day 
    All I design, or do, or say, 
    That all my power's, with all their might, 
    In Thy sole glory may unite. 

    4.
    Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

    Praise him above, ye heavenly host; 
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

    1.
    The sun is on the land and sea, 
    The day begun; 
    Our morning hymn begins with Thee, 
    Blest Three in One: 
    Our praise shall rise continually 
    Till day is done. 

    2.
    Thy love was ever in our view, 
    Like stars, by night; 
    Thy gifts are ev'ry morning new, 
    O God of light; 
    Thy mercy, like the heavens' blue, 
    Fills all our sight. 

    3.
    We do not know what grief or care 
    The day may bring: 
    The heart shall find some gladness there 
    That loves its King; 
    The life that serves Thee ev'rywhere 
    Can always sing. 

    4.
    All glory to the Father be, 
    With Christ the Son, 
    And, Holy Spirit, unto Thee, 
    Forever One; 
    All glory to the Trinity 
    While ages run.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U7ECgFzl07h2fEFHY87FvAzxSznDrY08/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Sweet is the work, my God, my King, 
    To praise Thy Name, give thanks and sing; 
    To show Thy love by morning light, 
    And talk of all Thy truth at night. 

    2.
    Sweet is the day of sacred rest; 
    No mortal cares shall seize my breast; 
    O may my heart in tune be found, 
    Like David's harp of solemn sound! 

    3.
    My heart shall triumph in my Lord, 
    And bless His works, and bless His Word. 
    Thy works of grace, how bright they shine! 
    How deep Thy counsels, how divine! 

    4.

    Forth in Thy Name, O Lord, I go, 
    My daily labor to pursue; 
    Thee, only Thee, resolved to know 
    In all I think, or speak, or do. 

    2.
    The task Thy wisdom hath assigned 
    O let me cheerfully fulfill; 
    In all my works Thy presence find, 
    And prove Thy good and perfect will. 

    3.
    Give me to bear Thy easy yoke, 
    And every moment watch and pray; 
    And still to things eternal look, 
    And hasten to Thy glorious day: 

    4.
    For Thee delightfully employ 
    Whate'er Thy bounteous grace hath given; 
    And run my course with even joy, 
    And closely walk with Thee to heaven.

    1.
    Softly now the light of day
    Fades upon out sight away:
    Free from care, from labor free,
    Lord, we would commune with Thee.

    2.
    Thou, whose allpervading eye
    Nought escapes, without, within,
    Pardon each infirmity,
    Open fault, and secret sin.

    3.
    Soon from us the light of day
    Shall forever pass away;
    Then, from sin and sorrow free,
    Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.

    Savior, breathe an evening blessing,
    Ere repose our spirits seal;
    Sin and want we come confessing;
    Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

    2.
    Though the night be dark and dreary,
    Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
    Thou art He who, never weary,
    Watchest where Thy people be.

    3.
    Though destruction walk around us.
    Though the arrow past us fly,
    Angel guards from Thee Surround us,
    We are safe if Thou art nigh.

    4.
    Should swift death this night o're-take us,
    And our couch become our tomb,
    May the morn of glory wake us,
    Clad in light and deathless bloom.

    Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!
    When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    2.
    Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

    3.
    I need Thy presence every passing hour.
    What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
    Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

    4.
    I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
    Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFsejAwZXlTfbAX5h8a2N5F18CE9VpOZ/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Day is dying in the west;
    Heaven is touching earth with rest;
    Wait and worship while the night
    Sets the evening lamps alight
    Through all the sky.
    Refrain:
    Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
    Heaven and earth are full of Thee!
    Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
    O Lord most high!

    2.
    Lord of life, beneath the dome
    Of the universe, Thy home,
    Gather us who seek Thy face
    To the fold of Thy embrace,
    For Thou art nigh.

    3.
    While the deepening shadows fall,
    Heart of love enfolding all,
    Through the glory and the grace
    Of the stars that veil Thy face,
    Our hearts ascend.

    4.
    When forever from our sight
    Pass the stars, the day, the night,
    Lord of angels, on our eyes
    Let eternal morning rise
    And shadows end.

    1.
    Now the day is over,
    night is drawing nigh,
    Shadows of the evening
    steal across the sky.

    2.
    Father, give the weary,
    calm and sweet repose;
    With Thy tenderest blessing
    May our eyelids close.

    3.
    Through the long night watches,
    may thine angels spread
    Their white wings above me,
    watching round my bed.

    All praise to thee, my God, this night,
    for all the blessings of the light!
    Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
    beneath thine own almighty wings.

    2.
    Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
    the ill that I this day have done,
    that with the world, myself, and thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

    3.
    O may my soul on thee repose,
    and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
    sleep that may me more vigorous make
    to serve my God when I awake.

    4.
    Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
    praise him, all creatures here below;
    praise him above, ye heavenly host;
    praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
 
 

## 54.  The Shadows of the Evening Hours
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCUEydYb_KSL38zNkuuG_%2DOznw7bFvJY/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The shadows of the evening hours 
    Fall from the darkening sky, 
    Upon the fragrance of the flowers 
    The dews of evening lie. 
    Before Thy throne, O Lord of heaven, 
    We kneel at close of day; 
    Look on Thy children from on high, 
    And hear us while we pray. 

    2.
    The sorrows of Thy servants, Lord, 
    O do not Thou despise, 
    But let the incense of our prayers 
    Before Thy mercy rise; 
    The brightness of the coming night 
    Upon the darkness rolls; 
    With hopes of future glory chase 
    The shadows on our souls. 

    3.
    Let peace, O Lord! Thy peace, O God, 
    Upon our souls descend; 
    From midnight fears, and perils, Thou 
    Our trembling hearts defend: 

    8.Give us a respite from our toil, 
    Calm and subdue our woes; 
    Through the long day we labor, Lord, 
    O give us now repose.
 
 

## 55.  Now God Be With Us

    1.
    Now God be with us, for the night is closing: 
    The light and darkness are of His disposing, 
    And 'neath His shadow here to rest we yield us, 
    For He will shield us. 

    2.
    Let evil thoughts and spirits flee before us; 
    Till morning cometh, watch, O Master, o'er us; 
    In soul and body Thou from harm defend us, 
    Thine angels send us. 

    3.
    We have no refuge, none on earth to aid us, 
    Save Thee, O Father, who Thine own hast made us; 
    But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely 
    Who seek Thee only. 

    4.
    Father, Thy Name be praised, Thy kingdom given, 
    Thy will be done on earth as 'tis in Heaven; 
    Keep us in life, forgive our sins, deliver 
    Us now and ever!
 
 

## 56.  'Again as Evening''s Shadow Falls'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rbw5EyEQI2DOa33uXP36mkuJL7dp0quB/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Again, as evening's shadow falls, 
    We gather in these hallowed walls; 
    And vesper hymn and vesper prayer 
    Rise mingling on the holy air. 

    2.
    May struggling hearts that seek release 
    Here find the rest of God's own peace; 
    And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer, 
    Lay down the burden and the care. 

    3.
    O God, our Light! to Thee we bow; 
    Within all shadows standest Thou; 
    Give deeper calm than night can bring; 
    Give sweeter songs than lips can sing. 
    Amen.
 
 

## 57.  The Day Thou Gavest
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReaOapH9Owdb1WZTB%2D_VUPsblk6l1Kri/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;
    the darkness falls at Thy behest;
    to Thee our morning hymns ascended;
    Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.

    2.
    We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping
    while earth rolls onward into light,
    through all the world her watch is keeping,
    and rests not now by day or night.

    3.
    As o'er each continent and island
    the dawn leads on another day,
    the voice of prayer is never silent,
    nor die the strains of praise away.

    4.
    So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
    like earth's proud empires, pass away.
    Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,
    till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
 
 

## 58.  Our Day of Praise Is Done
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCAbCX2IPxtzxXFjAqvXFDelFCVWEVhY/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Our day of praise is done; 
    The evening shadows fall; 
    But pass not from us with the sun, 
    True Light that lightenest all. 

    2.
    Around the throne on high, 
    Where night can never be, 
    The white robed harpers of the sky 
    Bring ceaseless hymns to Thee. 

    3.
    Too faint our anthems here; 
    Too soon of praise we tire; 
    But O the strains, how full and clear, 
    Of that eternal choir! 

    4.
    'Tis Thine each soul to calm, 
    Each wayward thought reclaim, 
    And make our life a daily psalm 
    Of glory to Thy Name. 

    5.
    A little while, and then 
    Shall come the glorious end; 
    And songs of angels and of men 
    In perfect praise shall blend.
 
 

## 59.  The Sun Rolls Down

    1.
    The sun rolls down the distant west. 
    Soft twilight steals abroad 
    To welcome in the day of rest, 
    The Sabbath of our Lord. 

    2.
    This holy day let us begin 
    With songs of praise to God, 
    Who pardons all our guilt and sin. 
    Through Jesus' precious blood. 

    3.
    Now in this tranquil hour we lay 
    All worldly cares aside, 
    And hallow God's most holy day, 
    Though friends or foes may chide. 

    4.
    'Tis not to seek the world's applause 
    That we from labor rest; 
    We strive to keep God's holy laws, 
    And He these moments blessed.

    1.
    O blessed hour, when evening comes, 
    And calls us to our place of prayer ! 
    with joyful heart our feet we turn 
    To meet Thee and Thy children there. 

    2.
    With one accord we gather here, 
    Our wants make known, our sins confess; 
    Dear Saviour, wilt Thou now appear, 
    And bless as only Thou canst bless. 

    3.
    Our faith increase, our fears remove; 
    Make strong the weak, the helpless raise; 
    May every heart now feel Thy love, 
    And every tongue speak forth Thy praise. 

    4.
    No want have we Thou canst not fill, 
    No need but Thou canst fully meet; 
    May we obey Thy gracious will, 
    And find our lives in Thee complete.

    1.
    The Sabbath day has reached its close, 
    Yet, Saviour, ere I seek repose, 
    Grant me the peace Thy love bestows; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    2.
    Weary I come to Thee for rest; 
    Hallow and calm my troubled breast; 
    Grant me Thy Spirit for my guest; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    3.
    Let not the gospel seed remain 
    Unfruitful, or be sown in vain; 
    Let heavenly dews descend like rain; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    4.
    O Jesus, Lord enthroned on high, 
    Thou hearest the contrite spirit's sigh; 
    Look down on me with pitying eye; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    5.
    My only intercessor Thou, 
    Mingle Thy fragrant incense now 
    With every prayer and every vow; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    6.
    And, oh, when time's short course shall end, 
    And death's dark shades around impend, 
    My God, my everlasting Friend, 
    Smile on my evening hour.
 
 

## 62.  Eternal Depth of Love Divine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAUwdCcyTjd1695NKMjUEKZMQGjvjoTx/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Eternal depth of love divine, 
    In Jesus, God with us, displayed; 
    How bright Thy beaming glories shine! 
    How wide Thy healing streams are spread, 
    How wide Thy healing streams are spread! 

    2.
    With whom dost Thou delight to dwell? 
    Sinners, a vile and thankless race! 
    O God, what tongue aright can tell 
    How vast Thy love, how great Thy grace? 
    How vast Thy love, how great Thy grace? 

    3.
    The dictates of Thy sovereign will 
    With joy our grateful hearts receive: 
    All thy delight in us fulfil; 
    Lo, all we are to Thee we give. 
    Lo, all we are to Thee we give. 

    4.
    To Thy sure love, Thy tender care, 
    Our flesh, soul, spirit, we resign: 
    O fix Thy sacred presence there, 
    And seal the abode for ever Thine! 
    And seal the abode for ever Thine!
 
 

## 63.  'Thy Mighty Love, O God'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAQcyXMH5wt3meV7JepMY4Dz2A8zq8BQ/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me, 
    As some strong tide it presseth on its way, 
    Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul, 
    Yearning to sweep all barriers away. 

    2.
    Shall I not yield to that constraining power? 
    Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in? 
    My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me, 
    Life cannot be as it hath hither been. 

    3.
    Break through my nature, mighty, heavenly Love, 
    Clear every avenue of thought and brain, 
    Flood my affections, purify my will, 
    Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain. 

    4.
    Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God, 
    Forth from my life, spontaneous and free, 
    Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace, 
    Loving, because God loved, eternally.
 
 

## 64.  'How Gentle God''s Commands'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qarkp_SxHypUMVxCrbwMoMH81ZfwtavE/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    How gentle God's commands! 
    How kind His precepts are! 
    Come, cast your burdens on the Lord, 
    And trust His constant care. 

    2.
    Beneath His watchful eye 
    His saints securely dwell; 
    That hand which bears all nature up 
    Shall guard His children well. 

    3.
    Why should this anxious load 
    Press down your weary mind? 
    Haste to your Heavenly Father's throne, 
    And sweet refreshment find. 

    4.
    His goodness stands approved 
    Through each succeeding day; 
    I'll drop my burden at His feet, 
    And bear a song away.
 
 

## 65.  'There''s a Wideness'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlPESbIqAqGVkd1NYTPa_kbAnSq34sh_/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    There's a wideness, in God's mercy, 
    Like the wideness of the sea; 
    There's a kindness in His justice, 
    Which is more than liberty. 

    2.
    There is welcome, for the sinner, 
    and more graces for the good; 
    There is mercy, with the Savior, 
    There is healing in His blood. 

    3.
    For the love of God is broader 
    Than the measure of man's mind. 
    And the heart of the Eternal, 
    is most wonderfully kind. 

    4.
    If our love were but more simple, 
    We should take Him at His word; 
    And our lives would be all sunshine, 
    In the sweetness of our Lord.
 
 

## 66.  Like as a Father
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QP_17w9Ch6cCzufeoBCw6Mx3DNaykp1B/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Like as a father pities his child, 
    So the Lord pities the sinner defiled; 
    Waiteth in kindness, 
    Pities our blindness, 
    Longeth to welcome, though often reviled. 

    2.
    Like as a father when we believe, 
    Merciful still, He will gladly receive; 
    Listens to hear us, 
    Blesses to cheer us, 
    Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve. 

    3.
    Like as a father, ever the same, 
    He hath created, and knoweth our frame; 
    Watcheth the straying, 
    Guardeth the praying, 
    Bids us to trust in His almighty name. 

    4.
    Like as a father, constant is He, 
    God in compassion regardeth our plea; 
    In need He cometh, 
    Precious His promise: 
    Father in heaven forever to be.
 
 

## 67.  O Love of God

    1.
    O love of God, how strong and true!
    Eternal, and yet ever new;
    Uncomprehended and unbought,
    Beyond all knowledge and all thought.

    2.
    O love of God, how deep and great,
    Far deeper than man's deepest hate;
    Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,
    Changeless, eternal, infinite.

    3.
    We read thee best in Him who cam
    To bear for us the cross of shame;
    Sent by the Father from on high,
    Our life to live, our death to die.

    4.
    We read thy power to bless and save,
    E'en in the darkness of the grave;
    Still more in resurrection light
    We read the fullness of thy might.

    5.
    O love of God, our shield and stay
    Through all the perils of our way!
    Eternal love, in thee we rest,
    Forever safe, forever blest.

    1.
    Jesus, Lord, we look to thee; 
    Let us in Thy name agree; 
    Show Thyself the Prince of Peace, 
    Bid our strife forever cease. 

    2.
    By Thy reconciling love 
    Every stumbling block remove; 
    Each to each unite, endear; 
    Come, and spread Thy banner here. 

    3.
    Make us of one heart and mind, 
    Courteous, pitiful and kind, 
    Lowly, meek, in thought and word, 
    Altogether like our Lord. 

    4.
    Let us for each other care, 
    Each the other's burdens bear; 
    To Thy church the pattern give, 
    Show how true believers live. 

    5.
    Free from anger and from pride, 
    Let us thus in God abide; 
    May our daily life express, 
    Constant love and holiness. 

    6.
    Let us then with joy remove 
    To the family above; 
    On the wings of angels fly, 
    To our mansions in the sky.

    1.
    High in the heavens, eternal God, 
    Thy goodness in full glory shines; 
    Thy truth shall break through every cloud 
    That veils and darkens Thy designs. 

    2.
    Forever firm Thy justice stands, 
    As mountains their foundations keep; 
    Wise are the wonders of Thy hands; 
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep. 

    3.
    O God! how excellent Thy grace, 
    Whence all our hope and comfort spring! 
    The sons of Adam in distress 
    Fly to the shadow of Thy wings. 

    4.
    In the provisions of Thy house 
    We still shall find a sweet repast; 
    There mercy like a river flows, 
    And brings salvation to our taste.

    Let us always think of Thee,

    Help us, Lord, to do Thy will, 
    That Thy Spirit may us fill. 

    3.

    1.
    Early my God, without delay 
    I haste to seek Thy face; 
    My thirsty spirit faints away 
    Without Thy cheering grace. 

    2.
    So pilgrims on the scorching sand, 
    Beneath a burning sky, 
    Long for a cooling stream at hand, 
    And they must drink or die. 

    3.
    I've seen Thy glory and Thy power 
    Through all Thy temple shine; 
    My God, repeat that heavenly hour, 
    That vision so divine.

    Not life itself, with all its joys,

    Or raise so high my cheerful voice 
    As Thy forgiving love.

    Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee, 
    Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; 
    Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee, 
    Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be. 

    3.
    Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee, 
    Though the eye of man Thy great glory may not see; 
    Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, 
    Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

    1.
    Round the Lord in glory seated, 
    Cherubim and seraphim 
    Filled His temple, and repeated 
    Each to each th'alternate hymn: 
    'Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven, 
    Earth is with Thy fullness stored; 
    Unto Thee be glory given, 
    Holy, holy, holy Lord.' 

    2.
    Heaven is still with glory ringing, 
    Earth takes up the angels' cry, 
    'Holy, holy, holy,' singing, 
    'Lord of Hosts, the Lord most high.' 
    With His seraph train before Him, 
    With His holy church below, 
    Thus unite we to adore him, 
    Bid we thus our anthem flow. 

    3.
    'Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven, 
    Earth is with Thy fullness stored; 
    Unto Thee be glory given, 
    Holy, holy, holy Lord.' 
    Thus Thy glorious name confessing, 
    With Thine angels hosts we cry, 
    'Holy, holy, holy,' blessing 
    Thee, the Lord of hosts Most High.
 
 

## 75.  O Worship the King
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mh_lINsLorwR7bxm%2DUcH56ght65MPyR8/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O worship the King, all glorious above,
    O gratefully sing His wonderful love;
    Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
    Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

    2.
    O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
    Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space,
    His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
    And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

    3.
    Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
    It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
    It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
    And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

    4.
    Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
    In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;
    Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!
    Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.
 
 

## 76.  The God of Abraham Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzeK3doFp0fyLjPSGCJ07Fhb86NcoirA/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The God of Abraham praise,
    Who reigns enthroned above;
    Ancient of everlasting days,
    And God of love;
    Jehovah! Great I AM!
    By earth and heaven confessed;
    I bow and bless the sacred name,
    Forever blest.

    2.
    The God of Abraham praise,
    At whose supreme command
    From earth I rise, and seek the joys
    At His right hand;
    I all on earth forsake,
    Its wisdom, fame and power;
    And Him my only portion make,
    My shield and tower.

    3.
    The whole triumphant host
    Give thanks to God on high;
    "Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
    They ever cry;
    Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
    I join the heavenly lays;
    All might and majesty are Thine,
    And endless praise.

    Most gracious, magnify the Lord.

    3.

## 78.  God the Omnipotent
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNTUskdFDWZIa0Pfh5cdK73_1zxKODtC/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest
    Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    2.
    God the all merciful! earth hath forsaken
    Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;
    Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    3.
    God the all righteousness One! man hath defied Thee;
    Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
    Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
    Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

    4.
    So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,
    For Thy deliverance from peril and sword,
    Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,
    "Thine is the power and the glory, O Lord."
 
 

## 79.  Ere Mounatins Reared Their Forms Sublime
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5C8YIGmhWJNnlmjObbfE_2TkkG4z3Kp/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Ere mountains reared their forms sublime, 
    Or heaven and earth in order stood, 
    Before the birth of ancient time, 
    From everlasting Thou art God. 

    2.
    A thousand years are in their flight, 
    With Thee but as a fleeting day; 
    Past, present, future, to Thy sight 
    At once their various scenes display. 

    3.
    But our brief life's a shadowy dream, 
    A passing thought that soon is o'er, 
    That fades with morning's earliest beam, 
    And fills the musing mind no more. 

    4.
    To us, O Lord, the wisdom give 
    Each passing moment so to spend, 
    That we at length with Thee may live 
    Where life and bliss shall never end.
 
 

## 80.  'Holy as Thou, O Lord'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpZvLKOj1vw6AvAF8cIUMhz1LR4yQTQa/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Holy as Thou, O Lord, is none; 
    Thy holiness is all Thine own; 
    A drop of that unbounded sea 
    Is ours'a drop derived from Thee. 

    2.
    And when Thy purity we share, 
    Thy brightest glory, we declare; 
    And, humbled into nothing, own, 
    Most holy, pure is God alone. 

    3.
    Sole, self-existing God and Lord, 
    By all Thy heavenly hosts adored, 
    Let all on earth bow down to Thee, 
    And own Thy peerless majesty. 

    4.
    Thy power unparalleled confess, 
    Established on the Rock of peace; 
    The rock that never shall remove, 
    The rock of pure, almighty love.
 
 

## 81.  'O God, Our Help'

    1.
    O God, our help in ages past,
    our hope for years to come,
    our shelter from the stormy blast,
    and our eternal home!

    2.
    Under the shadow of thy throne,
    still may we dwell secure;
    sufficient is thine arm alone,
    and our defense is sure.

    3.
    Before the hills in order stood,
    or earth received her frame,
    from everlasting, thou art God,
    to endless years the same.

    4.
    A thousand ages, in thy sight,
    are like an evening gone;
    short as the watch that ends the night,
    before the rising sun.

    5.
    O God, our help in ages past,
    our hope for years to come;
    be thou our guide while life shall last,
    and our eternal home!
 
 

## 82.  Beneath Thy Wing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TeZHA2TOl%2DMVzgon9eUXnDDdP3Yybvpr/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Beneath Thy wing, O God, I rest, 
    Under Thy shadow safely lie, 
    By Thine own strength in peace possest, 
    While dreaded evils pass me by. 

    2.
    With strong desire, I here can stay 
    To see Thy love its work complete; 
    Here can I wait a long delay, 
    Reposing at my Saviour's feet. 

    3.
    My place of lowly service, too, 
    Beneath that sheltering wing I see; 
    For all the work I have to do, 
    Is done through strengthening trust in Thee. 

    4.
    In faith and patience is repose, 
    In faith and rest my strength shall be; 
    And, when Thy joy the Church o'erflows, 
    I know that it will visit me.
 
 

## 83.  God of My Life
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U11ig3hfMi2%2DlD9%2DW6WKoufdMXqBGUQ0/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    God of my life, whose gracious power 
    Through varied scenes my soul hath led, 
    Or turned aside the fatal hour, 
    Or lifted up my sinking head. 

    2.
    In all my ways Thy hand I own, 
    Thy ruling providence I see: 
    Assist me still my course to run, 
    And still direct my paths to thee. 

    3.
    How do Thy mercies close me round! 
    Forever be Thy name adored; 
    I blush in all things to abound; 
    The servant of a gracious Lord. 

    4.
    I rest beneath Thy kindly shade; 
    My griefs expire, my troubles cease; 
    Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed, 
    Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.
 
 

## 84.  God Moves in a Mysterious Way
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tz0Va0CaUusLqbHnRtT1na2MfBBZUSAu/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    God moves in a mysterious way
    His wonders to perform;
    He plants His footsteps in the sea,
    And rides upon the storm.

    2.
    Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
    The clouds ye so much dread
    Are big with mercy, and shall break
    In blessings on your head.

    3.
    Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
    But trust Him for His grace;
    Behind a frowning providence
    He hides a smiling face.

    4.
    His purposes will ripen fast,
    Unfolding every hour;
    The bud may have a bitter taste,
    But sweet will be the flower.

    5.
    Blind unbelief is sure to err,
    And scan His work in vain;
    God is His own interpreter,
    And He will make it plain.
 
 

## 85.  Eternal Light
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGR6S1ziVcTAaCP_aFn4dcY6m1uO5NzV/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Eternal Light! Eternal Light! 
    How pure the soul must be 
    When, placed within Thy searching sight, 
    It shrinks not, but with calm delight 
    Can live, and look on Thee! 

    2.
    The spirits that surround Thy throne 
    May bear the burning bliss; 
    But surely that is theirs alone, 
    Who, undefiled, have never known 
    A fallen world like this. 

    3.
    O how shall I, whose native sphere 
    Is dark, whose mind is dim, 
    Before the Ineffable appear, 
    And on my naked spirit bear 
    The uncreated beam? 

    4.
    There is a way for man to rise 
    To that sublime abode: 
    An offering and a sacrifice, 
    A Holy Spirit's energies, 
    An Advocate with God. 

    5.
    These, these prepare us for the sight 
    Of holiness above; 
    The sons of ignorance and night, 
    May dwell in the eternal Light, 
    Through the eternal Love!
 
 

## 86.  the King of Love My Shepherd is
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TF5%2DDzT3q7H05EbUV1DZjXrt4FMI9rOs/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His,
    And He is mine forever.

    2.
    Where streams of living water flow
    My ransomed soul He leadeth,
    And, where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

    3.
    Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me,
    And on His shoulder gently laid,
    And home, rejoicing, brought me.

    4.
    And so through all the length of days
    Thy goodness faileth never;
    Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.

    Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us 
    O'er the world's tempestuos sea; 
    Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, 
    For we have no help but thee; 
    Yet possessing Every blessing 
    If our God our Father be. 

    2.
    Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us, 
    All our weakness thou dost know; 
    Thou didst tread this earth before us, 
    Thou didst feel its keenest woe; 
    Lone and dreary, Faint and weary, 
    Through the desert Thoudidst go. 

    3.
    Spirit of our God, descending, 
    Fill our hearts with heavenly joy; 
    Love with every passion blending, 
    Pleasure that can never cloy; 
    Thus provided, Pardoned, guided, 
    Nothing can our peace destroy.
 
 

## 88.  O God of Bethel
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TOwBCLqb6KQbLEOBGpTSJ484HYyEYlUK/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O God of Bethel, by whose hand 
    Thy people still are fed, 
    Who through this weary pilgrimage 
    Hast all our fathers led. 

    2.
    Our vows, our prayers, we now present 
    Before Thy throne of grace; 
    God of our fathers, be the God 
    Of their succeeding race. 

    3.
    Through each perplexing path of life 
    Our wandering footsteps guide; 
    Give us each day our daily bread, 
    And raiment fit provide. 

    4.
    O spread Thy covering wings around, 
    Till all our wanderings cease, 
    And at our Father's loved abode 
    We find at last Thy peace.

    1.
    God is the refuge of His saints, 
    When storms of sharp distress invade; 
    Ere we can offer our complaints, 
    Behold him present with His aid. 

    2.
    Loud may the troubled ocean roar; 
    In sacred peace our souls abide; 
    While every nation, every shore, 
    Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide. 

    3.
    There is a stream, whose gentle flow 
    Supplies the city of our God, 
    Life, love, and joy still gliding through, 
    And watering our divine abode. 

    4.
    That sacred stream, Thy holy word, 
    Our grief allays, our fear controls; 
    Sweet peace Thy promises afford, 
    And give new strength to fainting souls. 

    5.
    Zion enjoys her Monarch's love, 
    Secure against a threatening hour; 
    Nor can her firm foundation move, 
    Built on His truth, and armed with power.

    Major Key: E Flat

    1.
    Now thank we all our God
    With heart and hands and voices,
    Who wondrous things hath done,
    In whom His world rejoices;
    Who, from our mothers' arms
    Hath blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love,
    And still is ours today.

    2.
    O may this bounteous God
    Through all our life be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us;
    And keep us still in grace,
    And guide us when perplexed;
    And free us from all ills,
    In this world and the next.

    3.
    All praise and thanks to God
    The Father now be given;
    The Son, and Him who reigns
    With them in highest heaven;
    The one eternal God,
    Whom earth and heaven adore;
    For thus it was, is now,
    And shall be evermore.
 
 

## 91.  The Spacious Firmament
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8XjqVp9F_UZuWb0hU_DAOM8IwLhVQPM/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The spacious firmament on high,
    With all the blue, ethereal sky,
    And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
    Their great Original proclaim.
    Th'unwearied sun from day to day
    Does his Creator's power display,
    And publishes to every land
    The work of an almighty hand

    2.
    Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
    And nightly to the listening earth
    Repeats the story of her birth;
    While all the stars that round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole

    3.
    What though in solemn silence all
    Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
    What though no real voice nor sound
    Amid their radiant orbs be found?
    In reason's ear they all rejoice
    And utter forth a glorious voice,
    Forever singing as they shine,
    "The hand that made us is divine."
 
 

## 92.  There Is a Book

    1.
    There is a book that all may read, 
    Which heavenly truth imparts; 
    And all the lore its scholars need, 
    Pure eyes and Christian hearts. 

    2.
    The works of God above, below, 
    Within us, and around, 
    Are pages in that book, to show 
    How God Himself is found. 

    3.
    The glorious sky, embracing all, 
    Is like the Maker's love, 
    Wherewith encompassed, great and small 
    In peace and order move. 

    4.
    The dew of Heaven is like Thy grace, 
    It steals in silence down; 
    But where it falls, the favored place 
    By richest fruits is known. 

    5.
    Thou, who hast given me eyes to see, 
    And love for what is fair, 
    Give me a heart to find out Thee, 
    And read Thee everywhere.
 
 

## 93.  I Sing the Mighty Power
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QHe3Lw0Dipcm_0Ns%2DqVzDjASXL6tOrAD/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I sing the almighty power of God,
    that made the mountains rise,
    that spread the flowing seas abroad,
    and built the lofty skies.
    I sing the wisdom that ordained
    the sun to rule the day;
    the moon shines full at God's command,
    and all the stars obey.

    2.
    I sing the goodness of the Lord,
    who filled the earth with food,
    who formed the creatures thru the Word,
    and then pronounced them good.
    Lord, how thy wonders are displayed,
    where'er I turn my eye,
    if I survey the ground I tread,
    or gaze upon the sky!

    3.
    There's not a plant or flower below,
    but makes thy glories known,
    and clouds arise, and tempests blow,
    by order from thy throne;
    while all that borrows life from thee
    is ever in thy care;
    and everywhere that we can be,
    thou, God, art present there.
 
 

## 94.  All Beautiful the March of Days
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PQ4LOp6bhAZVVUf0rkXA6v_vpyrRnp6a/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    All beautiful the march of days, 
    As seasons come and go; 
    The Hand that shaped the rose hath wrought 
    The crystal of the snow; 
    Hath sent the hoary frost of heaven, 
    The flowing waters sealed, 
    And laid a silent loveliness 
    On hill and wood and field. 

    2.
    O'er white expanses sparkling pure 
    The radiant morns unfold; 
    The solemn splendors of the night 
    Burn brighter through the cold; 
    Life mounts in every throbbing vein, 
    Love deepens round the hearth, 
    And clearer sounds the angel hymn, 
    'Good will to men on earth.' 

    3.
    O Thou from Whose unfathomed law 
    The year in beauty flows, 
    Thyself the vision passing by 
    In crystal and in rose, 
    Day unto day doth utter speech, 
    And night to night proclaim, 
    In ever changing words of light, 
    The wonder of Thy Name.
 
 

## 95.  The Glory of the Spring
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLLUDOOgLi0joofvRWf6h7Cuvp_sB2Jm/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The glory of the spring how sweet, 
    The new-born life how glad; 
    What joy the happy earth to greet 
    In new, bright raiment clad. 
    Divine Redeemer, Thee I bless; 
    I greet Thy going forth; 
    I love Thee in the loveliness 
    Of Thy renewed earth. 

    2.
    But O these wonders of Thy grace, 
    These nobler works of Thine, 
    These marvels sweeter far to trace, 
    These new births more divine. 
    This new-born glow of faith so strong, 
    This bloom of love so fair, 
    This new-born ecstasy of song 
    And fragrancy of prayer! 

    3.
    Creator Spirit, work in me 
    These wonders sweet of Thine; 
    Divine Redeemer, graciously 
    Renew this heart of mine. 
    Still let new life and strength upspring, 
    Still let new joy be given; 
    And grant the glad new song to ring 
    Through the new earth and heaven.
 
 

## 96.  Glorious Are the Lofty Mountains
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCOR1uhWvz0FnnzP0eyE_RrrgGFJT5OP/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Glorious are the lofty mountains 
    In the early morning's gleam, 
    When the soft glow of the sunshine 
    Lights them with its golden beam. 

    2.
    How those vapors, gently floating, 
    Kiss the great snowcrested peaks! 
    In the splendor of the mountains 
    Our Creator surely speaks. 

    3.
    Oft of old the psalmist David, 
    Playing harp of solemn sound, 
    Sung his songs of God's protection 
    When he viewed the hills around. 

    4.
    Sunset rays o'er Judah's mountains 
    Touched the clouds with heavenly light 
    Till they seemed like hosts of angels 
    Sent to guard him through the night. 

    5.
    Wondrous everlasting mountains! 
    Symbols of Jehovah's might! 
    There earth reaches up to heaven, 
    There heaven first gives earth its light.

    Lord of the storm, supreme in power, 
    Send forth Thy light in earth's dark hour;

    Advance Thy truth o'er all our race. 

    3.
    Lord of the bounds of east and west, 
    Speed on Thy great millennial rest 
    Till saints of every age and clime 
    Behold Thy glorious form divine.

    Supreme o'er all Thy vast domain; 
    Let universal voices sing

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXmTjFoqXy9Dh5L1cs2BJGm5XYI5N84d/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    On hills and vales of heaven, 
    Where falls no shade of gloom, 
    Where all is peace and glory, 
    Are wondrous flowers in bloom. 
    But Thou, oh, Thou art fairer 
    Than any flower that grows, 
    Our lily of the valley 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

    2.
    Within the many mansions 
    Are jewels heavenly fair; 
    But Thou art far more precious 
    Than all the treasures there; 
    Most perfect in Thy beauty 
    Of all that heaven knows, 
    Our pearl of price forever, 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

    3.
    The flowers of earth have perished, 
    Its glories all have died; 
    For where all joys were transient 
    No beauty could abide; 
    But Thou art ours forever, 
    Where life's bright river flows, 
    Our lily of the valley 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose.
 
 

## 99.  It Came Upon the Midnight Clear
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNZUznUIc0gxwl8hLjLLUe5wt32DH1pO/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    It came upon the midnight clear, 
    That glorious song of old, 
    From angels bending near the earth, 
    To touch their harps of gold: 
    "Peace on the earth, goodwill to men 
    From heavens all gracious King;" 
    The world in solemn stillness lay, 
    To hear the angels sing. 

    2.
    Still through the cloven skies they come, 
    With peaceful wings unfurled; 
    And still their heavenly music floats 
    O'er all the weary world: 
    Above its sad and lowly plains 
    They bend on hovering wing, 
    And ever o'er its Babel sounds 
    The blessed angels sing. 

    3.
    And ye, beneath life's crushing load, 
    Whose forms are bending low, 
    Who toil along the climbing way 
    With painful steps and slow' 
    Look now! for glad and golden hours 
    Come swiftly on the wing; 
    O rest beside the weary road, 
    And hear the angels sing.

    1.
    To us a Child of hope is born; 
    To us a Son is given; 
    Him shall the tribes of earth obey, 
    Him all the hosts of heaven, 
    Him all the hosts of heaven. 

    2.
    His Name shall be the Prince of peace, 
    Forevermore adorned, 
    The Wonderful, the Counselor, 
    The great and mighty Lord! 
    The great and mighty Lord! 

    3.
    His power, increasing, still shall spread, 
    His reign no end shall know; 
    Justice shall guard His throne above, 
    And peace abound below, 
    And peace abound below.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Avd_i6U0s3oWEWldkm66YRGQ8e0Foe2Q/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
    All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
    And glory shone around.

    2.
    "Fear nor!" said he- for mighty dread
    Had seized their troubled mind-
    'Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
    To you and all mankind.

    3.
    To you, in David's town this day,
    Is born of David's line,
    The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
    And this shall be the sign:

    4.
    "The heavenly Babe you there shall find
    To human view displayed,
    All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
    And in a manger laid."

    5.
    Thus spake the seraph; and forth with
    Appeared a shining throng
    Of angels praising God on high,
    Who thus addressed their song:

    6.
    "All glory be to God on high,
    And to the earth be peace;
    Good will henceforth from heaven to men,
    Begin and never cease!"

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ax8qbjcVFB%2D9VDOw3xOSmcg9kdNC%2DBbg/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Silent night! holy night!
    All is calm, all is bright
    Round yon virgin mother and Child,
    Holy Infant so tender and mild,
    Sleep in heavenly peace,
    sleep in heavenly peace.

    2.
    Silent night! holy night!
    Shepherds quake at the sight,
    glories stream from heaven afar,
    heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
    Christ, the Savior is born,
    Christ, the Savior is born.

    3.
    Silent night! holy night!
    Son of God, love's pure light,
    Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
    with the dawn of redeeming grace,
    Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
    Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
 
 

## 103.  Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AcInZr6YuAh8lk4Luib6S1vW_RRlSej2/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Thou didst leave Thy throne
    And Thy kingly crown
    When Thou camest to earth for me;
    But in Bethlehem's home
    Was there found no room
    For Thy holy nativity.
    Refrain:
    O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee.

    2.
    Heaven's arches rang
    When the angels sang
    Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
    But of lowly birth
    Didst Thou come to earth,
    And in greatest humility.

    3.
    The foxes found rest,
    And the birds their nest
    In the shade of the forest tree;
    But Thy couch was the sod,
    O Thou Son of God,
    In the deserts of Galilee.

    4.
    Thou camest, O Lord,
    With the living word
    That should set Thy people free;
    But with mocking scorn,
    And with crown of thorn,
    They bore Thee to Calvary.

    5.
    When the heavens shall ring,
    And the angels sing,
    At Thy coming to victory,
    Let Thy voice call me home,
    Saying, "Yet there is room,
    There is room at My side for thee."
    Refrain:
    My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
    When Thou comest and callest for me.
 
 

## 104.  O Little Town of Bethlehem
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_T7qZqks3FgKNUtwodvOeF2q1xYF4p1/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!
    Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;
    The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

    2.
    For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
    While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.
    O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,
    And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!

    3.
    How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv'n;
    So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heav'n.
    No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.

    4.
    O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today.
    We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;
    O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!

    O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
    Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

    2.
    Sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation,
    O sing all ye citizens of heaven above!
    Glory to God, all glory in the highest!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

    3.
    Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
    Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
    Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
 
 

## 106.  'There''s a Song in the Air'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BG5NmCk3PKK3RodYXX5mLaqBFol9hdNx/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    There's a song in the air! 
    There's a star in the sky! 
    There's a mother's deep prayer 
    And a baby's low cry! 
    And the star rains its fire 
    While the beautiful sing, 
    For the manger of Bethlehem 
    Cradles a King! 

    2.
    There's a tumult of joy 
    O'er the wonderful birth, 
    For the virgin's sweet boy 
    Is the Lord of the earth. 
    Aye! the star rains its fire 
    While the beautiful sing, 
    For the manger of Bethlehem 
    Cradles a King! 

    3.
    In the light of that star 
    Lie the ages impearled; 
    And that song from afar 
    Has swept over the world. 
    Every hearth is aflame, 
    And the beautiful sing 
    In the homes of the nations 
    That Jesus is King! 

    4.
    We rejoice in the light, 
    And we echo the song 
    That comes down through the night 
    From the heavenly throng. 
    Aye! we shout to the lovely 
    Evangel they bring, 
    And we greet in his cradle 
    Our Savior and King!
 
 

## 107.  We Three Kings of Orient
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AqaQMWVbZeZskUtxfe3BjUqrnsLltuvE/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    We three kings of Orient are;
    Bearing gifts we traverse afar
    Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
    Following yonder star.
    Refrain:
    O star of wonder, star of night,
    Star with royal beauty bright,
    Westward leading, still proceeding,
    Guide us to Thy perfect light.

    2.
    Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
    Gold I bring to crown Him again,
    King forever, ceasing never
    Over us all to reign.

    3.
    Frankincense to offer have I;
    Incense owns a Deity nigh;
    Prayer and praising all men raising,
    Worship Him, God on high.

    4.
    Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
    Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
    Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
    Sealed in the stonecold tomb.

    5.
    Glorious now behold Him arise,
    King and God and sacrifice;
    Alleluia, Alleluia!
    Sounds through the earth and skies.
 
 

## 108.  The First Noel
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B2G1OxkK9hBQgMWvRM3236ZNRY_Q1zLO/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The first noel the angel did say
    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay;
    In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
    On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
    Refrain:
    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel

    2.
    They looked up and say a star
    Shining in the east, beyond them far,
    And to the earth it gave great light,
    And so it continued both day and night.

    3.
    And by the light of that same star,
    Three wise men came from country far,
    And to the earth it gave great light,
    And to follow the star wherever it went.

    4.
    This star drew nigh to the northwest,
    O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
    And there it did both stop and stay,
    Right over the place where Jesus lay.

    5.
    Then entered in those wise men three,
    Full reverently upon the knee,
    And offered there, in His presence,
    Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

    1.
    O come, O come, Emmanuel,
    And ransom captive Israel,
    That mourns in lonely exile here
    Until the Son of God appear.
    Refrain:
    Rejoice! Rejoice!
    Emmanuel shall come to thee,
    O Israel.

    2.
    O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
    And order all things far and night;
    To us the path of knowledge show,
    And cause us in her ways to go.

    3.
    O come, Desire of nations, bind
    All peoples in one heart and mind;
    Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease;
    Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.

    1.
    All my heart this night rejoices, 
    As I hear, 
    Far and near, 
    Sweetest angel voices; 
    "Christ is born," their choirs are singing, 
    Till the air, 
    Everywhere, 
    Now with joy is ringing. 

    2.
    Hark! a voice from yonder manger, 
    Soft and sweet, 
    Doth entreat: 
    "Flee from woe and danger; 
    Brethren, come; from all that grieves you, 
    You are freed; 
    All you need 
    I will surely give you." 

    3.
    Come, then, let us hasten yonder; 
    Here let all, 
    Great and small, 
    Kneel in awe and wonder; 
    Love Him who with love is yearning; 
    Hail the star, 
    That from far 
    Bright with hope is burning!

    1.
    Hark! the herald angels sing,

    peace on earth, and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled!"
    Joyful, all ye nations rise,
    join the triumph of the skies;
    with th' angelic host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
    Hark! the herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the new born King!"

    2.
    Christ, by highest heaven adored;
    Christ, the everlasting Lord;
    late in time behold him come,
    offspring of a virgin's womb.
    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
    hail th' incarnate Deity,
    pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel.
    Hark! the herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the new born King!"

    3.
    Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
    Light and life to all he brings,
    risen with healing in his wings.
    Mild he lays his glory by,
    born that we no more may die,
    born to raise us from the earth,
    born to give us second birth.
    Hark! the herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the new born King!"
 
 

## 112.  As With Gladness Men of Old
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rhnQOt6aFxEnwWeJEb7pulovVkHabhQ/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    As with gladness men of old
    Did the guiding star behold,
    As with joy they hailed its light,
    Leading onward, beaming bright,
    So, most gracious Lord, may we
    Evermore be led to Thee.

    2.
    As with joyful steps they sped
    To that lowly manger bed,
    There to bend the knee before
    Him whom heav'n and earth adore,
    So may we with willing feet
    Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

    3.
    As they offered gifts most rare
    At that manger rude and bare,
    So may we with holy joy,
    Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
    All our costliest treasures bring,
    Christ, to Thee our heav'nly King.

    4.
    Holy Jesus, every day
    Keep us in the narrow way;
    And, when earthly things are past,
    Bring our ransomed souls at last
    Where they need no star to guide,
    Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

    Come and worship, Come and worship,

    Come and worship, Come and worship,
    Worship Christ, the newborn King.

    3.
    Sages, leave your contemplations,
    Brighter visions beam afar;
    Seek the great Desire of nations;
    Ye have seen His natal star;
    Come and worship, Come and worship,
    Worship Christ, the newborn King.

    4.
    Saints, before the altar bending,
    Watching long in hope and fear,

    In His temple shall appear;
    Come and worship, Come and worship,
    Worship Christ, the newborn King.

    1.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How Beautiful they seem, 
    Like fountains flowing in the dark 
    Or waters in a dream ! 
    Like waters under Syrian stars 
    Reflecting lights above, 
    Repeating in their silent depths 
    The wonder of God's love. 

    2.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How marvelous they lie, 
    As open to the smile of God 
    As to the Syrians sky ! 
    As open to the heart of man 
    As to the genial sun, 
    With dreams of high asventuring, 
    And deeds of kindness done. 

    3.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How radiant they rise 
    With life and death in balance laid 
    Before a lad's clear eyes ! 
    O soul of youth, forever choose, 
    Forgetting fate or fear, 
    To live for truth, or die with God, 
    Who stands beside thee here.
 
 

## 115.  When the Lord of Love Was Here
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hjE3a0s6WnNJu%2D0cA%2DEv9GRuk_yiHo2/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    When the Lord of love was here, 
    Happy hearts to Him were dear, 
    Though His heart was sad; 
    Worn and lonely for our sake, 
    Yet he turned aside to make 
    All the weary glad. 

    2.
    Meek and lowly were His ways, 
    From His loving grew His praise, 
    From His giving, prayer; 
    All the outcast thronged to hear, 
    All the sorrowful drew near 
    To enjoy His care. 

    3.
    When he walked the fields, He drew 
    From the flowers and birds and dew, 
    Parables of God; 
    For within His heart of love 
    All the soul of man did move, 
    God had His abode. 

    4.
    Lord, be ours Thy power to keep 
    In the very heart of grief, 
    And in trial, love. 
    In our meekness to be wise, 
    And through sorrows to arise 
    To' our God above. 

    5.
    Fill us with Thy deep desire 
    All the sinful to inspire, 
    With the Father's life; 
    Free us from the cares that press 
    On the heart of worldliness 
    From the fret and strife.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qj7mUcYLSGJoj5JG276m1fJy5uBcqgr/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Dear Lord and Father of mankind, 
    Forgive our feverish ways; 
    Reclothe us in our rightful mind, 
    In purer lives Thy service find, 
    In deeper reverence, praise. 

    2.
    In simple trust like theirs who heard, 
    Beside the Syrian sea, 
    The gracious calling of the Lord, 
    Let us, like them, without a word, 
    Rise up and follow Thee. 

    3.
    O Sabbath rest by Galilee, 
    O calm of hills above! 
    Where Jesus knelt to share with thee 
    The silence of eternity, 
    Interpreted by love. 

    4.
    Drop thy still dews of quietness, 
    Till all our strivings cease, 
    Take from our souls the strain and stress, 
    And let our ordered lives confess 
    The beauty of thy peace. 

    5.
    Breathe through the heats of our desire, 
    Thy coolness and thy balm; 
    Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; 
    Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, 
    O still small voice of calm!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16S6euD65BEqn_Syr4lL8bUuLFiJj1iGj/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Prince of Peace, control my will,
    Bid this struggling heart be still;
    Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
    Hush my spirit into peace.

    2.
    Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,
    Opened wide the gate to God;
    Peace, I ask, but peace must be,
    Lord, in being one with Thee.

    3.
    May Thy will, not mine, be done,
    May Thy will and mine be one;
    Chase these doubtings from my heart,
    Now Thy perfect peace impart.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QA5xNMNN7aGqXHIc8QMPdBtY_dvcHrY/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the Prince of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

    2.
    See, from His head, His feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

    3.
    Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon through His name and word;
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.

    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross
    on which the Prince of Glory died;
    my richest gain I count but loss,
    and pour contempt on all my pride.

    2.
    Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
    save in the death of Christ, my God;
    all the vain things that charm me most,
    I sacrifice them to his blood.

    3.
    See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    sorrow and love flow mingled down.
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
    or thorns compose so rich a crown.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    that were an offering far too small;
    love so amazing, so divine,
    demands my soul, my life, my all.

    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross 
    On which the Prince of glory died, 
    My richest gain I count but loss, 
    And pour contempt on all my pride. 

    2.
    See, from His head, His feet, 
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet? 
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

    3.
    Since I, who was undone and lost, 
    Have pardon through His name and word; 
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast, 
    Save in the cross of Christ my Lord. 

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
    That were a tribute far too small; 
    Love so amazing, so divine, 
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.
 
 

## 121.  '''Tis Midnight; and on Olives'' Brow'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COAjQdTDRwN4FsRy_tRcevXmp8VAaJp5/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow 
    The star is dimmed that lately shone: 
    'Tis midnight; in the garden, now, 
    The suffering Savior prays alone. 

    2.
    'Tis midnight; and from all removed, 
    The Saviour wrestles lone with fears; 
    E'en that disciple whom He loved 
    Heeds not His Master's grief and tears. 

    3.
    'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt 
    The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood; 
    Yet He who hath in anguish knelt, 
    Is not forsaken by His God. 

    4.
    'Tis midnight; and from ether plains 
    Is borne the song that angels know; 
    Unheard by mortals are the strains 
    That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.
 
 

## 122.  Go to Dark Gethsemane
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTPe31uD0kJ9_4GEKRRLqoZpxBx8I1xo/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Go to dark Gethsemane,
    Ye who feel the tempter's power
    Your Redeemer's conflict see.
    Watch with him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from his griefs away;
    Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.

    2.
    See Him at the judgment hall,
    Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
    See Him meekly bearing all;
    Love to man His soul sustained!
    Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
    Learn from him to bear the cross.

    3.
    Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
    There, adoring at his feet,
    Mark that miracle of time,
    God's own sacrifice complete.
    "It is finished!" hear him cry;
    Learn from Jesus Christ to die.
 
 

## 123.  There Was One Who Was Willing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CL81lYnmS%2DoA3uyiDgMuduesJuMG%2DbZG/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    There was One who was willing to die in my stead, 
    That a soul so unworthy might live, 
    And the path to the cross He was willing to tread 
    All the sins of my life to forgive. 
    Refrain:
    They are nailed to the cross, 
    They are nailed to the cross, 
    O how much He was willing to bear! 
    With what anguish and loss, 
    Jesus went to the cross! 
    But He carried my sins with Him there. 

    2.
    He is tender and loving and patient with me, 
    While He cleanses my heart of its dross, 
    But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free, 
    For my sins were all nailed to the cross. 

    3.
    I will cling to my Savior and never depart' 
    I will joyfully journey each day, 
    With a song on my lips and a song in my heart, 
    That my sins have been taken away.
 
 

## 124.  'Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRQ8dDZOH5xVBqL4DjmB%2DHn8dqcWiH%2Dz/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Alas! and did my Savior bleed? 
    And did my Sovereign die? 
    Would He devote that sacred head 
    For sinners such as I? 

    2.
    Was it for crimes that I have done, 
    He groaned upon the tree? 
    Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
    And love beyond degree! 

    3.
    Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
    And shut its glories in, 
    When Christ, the mighty Maker, died 
    For man, the creature's sin. 

    4.
    Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
    While His dear cross appears, 
    Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
    And melt mine eyes to tears. 

    5.
    But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
    The debt of love I owe; 
    Here, Lord, I give myself away; 
    'Tis all that I can do.
 
 

## 125.  In the Cross of Christ I Glory
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4Ded_ElVhYs04YtTkv%2DdHpFuadcezBv/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    In the cross of Christ I glory,
    towering o'er the wrecks of time;
    all the light of sacred story
    gathers round its head sublime.

    2.
    When the woes of life o'ertake me,
    hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
    never shall the cross forsake me.
    Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

    3.
    When the sun of bliss is beaming
    light and love upon my way,
    from the cross the radiance streaming
    adds more luster to the day.

    4.
    Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
    by the cross are sanctified;
    peace is there that knows no measure,
    joys that through all time abide.
 
 

## 126.  There Is a Green Hill Far Away
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CIKjlezn4lWIRbhWbTTD7LFOjvgxrBHu/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    There is a green hill far away,
    Without a city wall,
    Where the dear Lord was crucified,
    Who died to save us all.

    2.
    We may not know, we cannot tell,
    What pains He had to bear,
    But we believe it was for us
    He hung and suffered there.

    3.
    He died that we might be forgiven,
    He died to make us good,
    That we might go at last to heaven,
    Saved by His precious blood.

    4.
    There was no other good enough
    To pay the price of sin;
    He only could unlock the gate
    Of heaven, and let us in.

    5.
    O dearly, dearly has He loved!
    And we must love Him too,
    And trust in His redeeming blood,
    And try His works to do.
 
 

## 127.  Ride On in Majesty
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C086d30tormNz%2DQmVh2DZ6dinPiVKyFn/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Ride on! ride on in majesty!
    Hark, all the tribes hosanna cry;
    O Savior meek, pursue Thy road
    With palms and scattered garments strowed.

    2.
    Ride on! ride on in majesty!
    In lowly pomp ride on to die;
    O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
    O'er captive death and conquered sin.

    3.
    Ride on! ride on in majesty!
    The winged squadrons of the sky
    Look down with sad and wondering eyes
    To see the approaching sacrifice.

    4.
    Ride on! ride on in majesty!
    In lowly pomp ride on to die;
    Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
    Then take, O God, Thy power and reign.
 
 

## 128.  Into the Woods My Master Went
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C0gQN_wsVg7IZ0AJm5TCrBwOTLEf_IFG/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Into the woods my Master went, 
    Clean forspent, forspent, 
    Into the woods my Master came, 
    Forspent with love and shame. 
    But the olives they were not blind to Him. 
    The little grey leaves were kind to Him, 
    The thorn tree had a mind to Him, 
    When into the woods He came. 

    2.
    Out of the woods my Master went, 
    And he was well content; 
    Out of the woods my Master came, 
    Content with death and shame. 
    When death and shame would woo Him last, 
    From under the trees they drew Him last, 
    'Twas on a tree they slew Him last, 
    When out of the woods He came.
 
 

## 129.  Behold the Lamb of God
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3_MvaRfzoMy_2G8VArGE9S2A6Vud44R/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Behold the Lamb of God! 
    O Thou for sinners slain, 
    Let it not be in vain 
    That Thou hast died; 
    Thee for my Savior let me take, 
    My only refuge let me make 
    Thy pierced side. 

    2.
    Behold the Lamb of God! 
    Into the sacred flood 
    Of Thy most precious blood 
    My soul I cast; 
    Wash me and make me clean within, 
    And keep me pure from every sin, 
    Till life be past. 

    3.
    Behold the Lamb of God! 
    All hail, incarnate Word, 
    Thou everlasting Lord, 
    Savior most blest; 
    Fill us with love that never faints, 
    Grant us with all Thy blessed saints 
    Eternal rest. 

    4.
    Behold the Lamb of God! 
    Worthy is He alone, 
    To sitteth on the Throne 
    Of God above; 
    One with the Ancient of all days, 
    One with the Comforter in praise, 
    All light and Love
 
 

## 130.  O Sacred Head Now Wounded
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPPAaY2VVPBCAyatdpmFcA4J85cOojTl/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O sacred Head, now wounded,
    with grief and shame weighed down,
    now scornfully surounded
    with thorns, thine only crown:
    how pale thou art with anguish,
    with sore abuse and scorn!
    How does that visage languish
    which once was bright as morn!

    2.
    What thou, my Lord, has suffered
    was all for sinners' gain;
    mine, mine was the transgression,
    but thine the deadly pain.
    Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
    'Tis I deserve thy place;
    look on me with thy favor,
    vouchsafe to me thy grace.

    3.
    What language shall I borrow
    to thank thee, dearest friend,
    for this thy dying sorrow,
    thy pity without end?
    O make me thine forever;
    and should I fainting be,
    Lord, let me never, never
    outlive my love for thee.

## 132.  Our Lord Is Risen
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17K0R1e641zq5lkmwqfizpPk7562k9Sgx/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Our Lord is risen from the dead; 
    Our Jesus is gone up on high! 
    A captive host He joyful led, 
    To the bright portals of the sky. 

    2.
    There His triumphal chariot waits, 
    And angels chant the solemn lay: 
    "Lift up your heads, ye heavenly gates; 
    Ye everlasting doors, give way." 

    3.
    Loose all your bars of golden light, 
    And wide unfold the beauteous scene; 
    He claims these mansions as His right, 
    Receive the King of glory in. 

    4.
    Who is this King of glory? Who? 
    The Lord, that all our foes o'ercame; 
    The world, sin, death, and hell o'erthrew; 
    And Jesus is the conqueror's name. 

    5.
    Who is this King of Glory, Who? 
    The Lord, of glorious power possessed; 
    The King of saints and angels, too; 
    God over all, forever blest.
 
 

## 133.  On Wings of Living Light
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bp6HYBODt_l8o3rwF9QQoAgcSDi0Ysu/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    On wings of living light 
    At earliest dawn of day, 
    Came down the angel bright 
    And rolled the stone away. 
    Refrain:
    Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
    Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice. 
    Your voices raise with one accord 
    To bless and praise your risen Lord. 

    2.
    The keepers watching near, 
    At that dread sight and sound 
    Fell down with sudden fear, 
    Like dead men to the ground. 

    3.
    Then rose from death's dark gloom, 
    With angels standing by, 
    Triumphant o'er the tomb, 
    The Lord of earth and sky. 

    4.
    Ye children of the light, 
    Arise with Him, arise; 
    See, how the Day-star bright 
    Is burning in the skies!

    Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Alleluia!

    2.

## 135.  The Day of Resurrection
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17nFe%2D%2DGEcgzxcKt4f94kfaCRvQ9_5YA3/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The day of resurrection' 
    Earth, tell it out abroad' 
    The passover of gladness, 
    The passover of God. 
    From death to life eternal, 
    From this world to the sky, 
    Our Christ hath brought us over, 
    With hymns of victory. 

    2.
    Our hearts be pure from evil, 
    That we may see aright 
    The Lord in rays eternal 
    Of resurrection light, 
    And, listening to his accents, 
    May hear, so calm and plain, 
    His own "All hail!" and, hearing, 
    May raise the victor strain. 

    3.
    Now let the heavens be joyful, 
    Let earth the song begin, 
    Let the round world keep triumph 
    And all that is therein; 
    Invisible and visible, 
    Their notes let all things blend, 
    For Christ the Lord hath risen, 
    Our joy that hath no end.

    1.
    O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
    O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
    Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

    2.
    Sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation,
    O sing all ye citizens of heaven above!
    Glory to God, all glory in the highest!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

    3.
    Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
    Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
    Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
    O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
 
 

## 137.  Where High the Heavenly Temple Stands
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Alsu2q7Cp87YLEZ2zoBMRYYgG1oR2Bj/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Where high the heavenly temple stands, 
    The house of God not made with hands, 
    A great High Priest our nature wears, 
    The Guardian of mankind appears. 

    2.
    He, who for men their surety stood, 
    And poured on earth his precious blood, 
    Pursues in heaven His mighty plan, 
    The Savior and the Friend of man. 

    3.
    In every pang that rends the heart 
    The Man of Sorrows had a part; 
    He sympathizes with our grief, 
    And to the sufferer sends relief. 

    4.
    With boldness therefore at the throne 
    Let us make all our sorrows known, 
    And ask the aid of heavenly power, 
    To help us in the evil hour.
 
 

## 138.  Within the Veil
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17otNaDSc%2Dp7aW9mO%2DmoTLIMUigXSvCi2/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    "Within the veil:" Be this, beloved thy portion 
    Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell; 
    Beholding Him, until thy face His glory, 
    Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell. 

    2.
    "Within the veil," for only as thou gazest 
    Upon the matchless beauty of His face, 
    Canst thou become a living revelation 
    Of His great heart of love, His untold grace. 

    3.
    "Within the veil," His fragrance poured upon thee, 
    Without the veil, that fragrance shed abroad; 
    "Within the veil," His hand shall tune the music 
    Which sounds on earth the praises of thy Lord. 

    3.
    "Within the veil," thy spirit deeply anchored, 
    Thou walkest calm above a world of strife; 
    "Within the veil," thy soul with Him united, 
    Shall live on earth His resurrection life.
 
 

## 139.  Since to the Holiest
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lgzenwTefkptRyUH1AC7HiOBMuQRdr8/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Since to the Holiest none may enter in 
    Save those whom Jesus' blood has cleansed from sin' 
    The blood is life, and must for sin atone; 
    Christ is my life, my life in Christ alone. 

    2.
    So when life's sun is sinking in the west, 
    I know that with the coming dawn comes rest; 
    And when the shadows show the close of day, 
    He who has conquered death shall light my way. 

    3.
    And as I've learned on earth the rest He gives, 
    And here to live with Him who ever lives, 
    I know where He is, at my God's right hand, 
    Must be my country and my Fatherland. 

    4.
    Thus may I prove in Christ my risen Lord 
    All that He's promised in His written word' 
    My life, my way, my home, my rest above, 
    When sleep of death shall wake to endless love.
 
 

## 140.  My Blest Redeemer
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17TA_HJGQeq51CVB0daYVAEOOD1VKp9mR/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    My blest Redeemer and my Lord, 
    I read my duty in Thy Word; 
    But in Thy life the law appears, 
    Drawn out in living characters. 

    2.
    What truth and love Thy bosom fill! 
    What zeal to do Thy Father's Will! 
    Such zeal, and truth, and love divine, 
    I would transcribe, and make them mine. 

    3.
    Cold mountains and the midnight air 
    Witnessed the fervor of Thy prayer; 
    The desert Thy temptations knew, 
    Thy conflict and Thy victory, too. 

    4.
    Be Thou my pattern; make me bear 
    More of Thy gracious image here; 
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name, 
    Among the followers of the Lamb.
 
 

## 141.  We May Not Climb
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19NphEyDtfhzBfYAq0vLACDvxQRZebStB/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    We may not climb the heavenly steeps 
    To bring the Saviour down; 
    In vain we search the lowest deeps, 
    For Him no depths can drown. 

    2.
    But warm, sweet, tender, even yet 
    A present help is He; 
    And faith has still its Olivet, 
    And love its Galilee. 

    3.
    The healing of the seamless dress 
    Is by our beds of pain; 
    We touch Him in life's throng and press, 
    And we are whole again. 

    4.
    O Lord and Master of us all, 
    Whate'er our name or sign, 
    We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call, 
    We test our lives by Thine!
 
 

## 142.  Love Divine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19RcUbY1eEfqv24N8cxMGOR2GiL3bU_q7/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Love divine, all loves excelling, 
    Joy of heaven, to earth come down; 
    Fix in us Thy humble dwelling; 
    All Thy faithful mercies crown! 
    Jesus Thou art all compassion, 
    Pure, unbounded love Thou art; 
    Visit us with Thy salvation; 
    Enter every trembling heart. 

    2.
    Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit 
    Into every troubled breast! 
    Let us all in thee inherit, 
    Let us find the promised rest; 
    Take away our bent to sinning; 
    Alpha and Omega be; 
    End of faith, as its beginning, 
    Set our hearts at liberty. 

    3.
    Come, Almighty to deliver, 
    Let us all Thy grace receive; 
    Suddenly return and never, 
    Nevermore Thy temples leave. 
    Thee we would be always blessing, 
    Serve Thee as Thy hosts above, 
    Pray and praise Thee without ceasing, 
    Glory in Thy perfect love. 

    4.
    Finish, then, Thy new creation; 
    Pure and spotless let us be; 
    Let us see Thy great salvation 
    Perfectly restored in Thee; 
    Changed from glory into glory, 
    Till in heaven we take our place, 
    Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
    Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
 
 

## 143.  The Wonders of Redeeming Love
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jLqvkZGF4dHSnrq6aFzR5hsyeHIKE_r/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The wonders of redeeming love
    Our highest thoughts exceed;
    The Son of God comes from above
    For sinful man to bleed.

    2.
    He gives Himself, His life, His all,
    A sinless sacrifice.
    For man He drains the cup of gall,
    For man the victim dies.

    3.
    And now before His Father's face
    His precious blood He pleads;
    For those who seek the throne of grace
    His love still intercedes.

    4.
    He knows the frailties of our frame,
    For He has borne our grief;
    Our great High Priest once felt the same,
    And He can send relief.

    5.
    His love will not be satisfied,
    Till He in glory sees
    The faithful ones for whom He died
    From sin forever free.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19P9Sv5qOPINcUA4c45PvCslYPPtxt0Tq/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    O love divine, that stooped to share 
    Our sharpest pang, our bitterest tear! 
    On Thee we cast each earthborn care; 
    We smile at pain while Thou art near. 

    2.
    Though long the weary way we tread, 
    And sorrow crown each lingering year, 
    No path we shun, no darkness dread; 
    Our hearts still whispering, 'Thou art near!' 

    3.
    When drooping pleasure turns to grief, 
    And trembling faith is changed to fear, 
    The murmuring wind, the quivering leaf, 
    Shall softly tell us, 'Thou art near!' 

    4.
    On Thee we fling our burdening woe, 
    O Love divine, forever dear; 
    Content to suffer while we know, 
    Living and dying, Thou art near!

    1.
    O Love that wilt not let me go,
    I rest my weary soul in thee;
    I give thee back the life I owe,
    that in thine ocean depths
    its flow may richer, fuller be.

    2.
    O Light that followest all my way,
    I yield my flickering torch to thee;
    my heart restores its borrowed ray,
    that in they sunshine's blaze
    its day may brighter, fairer be.

    3.
    O Joy that seekest me through pain,
    I cannot close my heart to thee;
    I trace the rainbow thru the rain,
    and feel the promise is not vain,
    that morn shall tearless be.

    4.
    O Cross that liftest up my head,
    I dare not ask to fly from thee;
    I lay in dust life's glory dead,
    and from the ground there blossoms
    red life that shall endless be.

    1.
    Jesus, Thy boundless love to me 
    No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
    O knit my thankful heart to Thee, 
    And reign without a rival there; 
    Thine wholly, Thine alone I am; 
    Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame. 

    2.
    O, grant that nothing in my soul 
    May dwell but Thy pure love alone; 
    Oh, may Thy love possess me whole, 
    My joy, my treasure, and my crown; 
    All coldness from my heart remove; 
    My every act, word, thought, be love. 

    3.
    O love, how cheering is thy ray! 
    All pain before thy presence flies; 
    Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away 
    Wherev'er Thy healing beams arise; 
    O Jesus, nothing may I see' 
    Nothing desire or seek, but Thee. 

    4.
    In suffering be Thy love my peace, 
    In weakness be Thy love my power; 
    And when the storms of life shall cease, 
    Jesus, in that important hour, 
    In death, as life, be Thou my guide, 
    And save me, who for me hast died.

    Dear Saviour, we would know Thy love 
    Which yet no measure knows; 
    For us it led Thee once to die; 
    From thence salvation flows. 

    2.
    Fain would we strike the golden harp, 
    And wear the promised crown, 
    And at Thy feet, while bending low, 
    Would sing what grace hath done. 

    3.
    Then leave us not in this dark world, 
    As strangers long to roam; 
    Come, Lord, and take us to Thyself, 
    Come, jesus, quickly come!

    1.
    O love divine, how sweet thou art! 
    When shall I find my willing heart 
    All taken up by thee? 
    I thirst, I faint, I die to prove 
    The greatness of redeeming love, 
    The love of Christ to me. 

    2.
    Stronger His love than death or hell; 
    Its riches are unsearchable; 
    The first born sons of light 
    Desire in vain its depths to see; 
    They cannot reach the mystery, 
    The length, and breadth, and height. 

    3.
    God only knows the love of God; 
    O that it now were shed abroad 
    In this poor stony heart! 
    For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
    This only portion, Lord, be mine' 
    Be mine this better part! 

    4.
    O that I could forever sit 
    With Mary at the Master's feet! 
    Be this my happy choice; 
    My only care, delight, and bliss, 
    My joy, my heaven on earth, be this 
    To hear the Bridegroom's voice.

    1.
    How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer�s ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.

    2.
    It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary, rest.

    3.
    Dear name, the rock on which I build,
    My shield and hiding place,
    My neverfailing treasury, filled
    With boundless stores of grace.

    4.
    Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
    My Prophet, Priest, and King!
    My Lord, my life, my way, my end!
    Accept the praise I bring.

    5.
    Weak is the effort of my heart,
    And cold my warmest thought;
    But when I see Thee as Thou art,
    I'll praise Thee as I ought.

    Th'incarnate God hath died for me! 
    The Father's wellbeloved Son 
    Bore all my sins upon the tree! 
    The Son of God for me hath died; 
    My Lord, my Love, is crucified. 

    2.

    Believe, believe the record true, 
    Ye all are bought with Jesus' blood; 
    Pardon for all flows from His side; 
    My Lord, my Love, is crucified. 

    3.

    A mortal man, ashamed of Thee? 
    Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise, 
    Whose glories shine through endless days? 

    2.
    Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far

    He sheds the beams of light divine 
    O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

    3.

    Let midnight be ashamed of noon; 
    'Twas midnight with my soul, till He 
    Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee. 

    4.
    Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend 
    On Whom my hopes of Heaven depend! 
    No; when I blush, be this my shame, 
    That I no more revere His Name. 

    5.
    Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may 
    When I've no guilt to wash away; 
    No tear to wipe, no good to crave, 
    No fears to quell, no soul to save. 
    Till then'nor is my boasting vain' 
    Till then I boast a Saviour slain: 
    And, O, may this my glory be,

    Honor, and majesty, and might:

    5.

    To them that find Thee, all in all. 

    3.

    And thirst our souls from Thee to fill! 

    4.
    Our restless spirits yearn for Thee, 
    Where-e'r our changeful lot is cast; 
    Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see, 
    Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast. 

    5.

    Make all our moments calm and bright; 
    Chase the dark night of sin away, 
    Shed o'r the world Thy holy light!

    He breaks the power of canceled sin,

    His blood can make the foulest clean; 
    His blood availed for me.

    He speaks, and listening to his voice, 
    New life the dead receive;

    The humble poor believe.

    His head with radiant light is crowned, 
    His lips with grace o'erflow, 
    His lips with grace o'erflow. 

    2.
    No mortal can with Him compare, 
    Among the sons of men; 
    Fairer is He than all the fair 
    That fill the heav'nly train, 
    That fill the heav'nly train. 

    3.
    He saw me plunged in deep distress, 
    And flew to my relief; 
    For me He bore the shameful cross, 
    And carried all my grief, 
    And carried all my grief. 

    4.
    To Him I owe my life and breath, 
    And all the joys I have; 
    He makes me triumph over death, 
    He saves me from the grave, 
    He saves me from the grave.

    To Heaven, the place of His abode, 
    He brings my weary feet; 
    Shows me the glories of my God, 
    And makes my joys complete, 
    And makes my joys complete. 

    6.
    Since from His bounty I receive 
    Such proofs of love divine,

    The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
    The air is perfumed with His breath.

    3.
    His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
    To water the gardens of grace;
    From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
    And bask in the smiles of His face.

    4.
    He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
    And myriads wait for His word;
    He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
    Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

    those wounds, yet visible above,
    in beauty glorified;
    No angel in the sky
    Can fully bear that sight,
    But downward bend his wondering eye
    At mysteries so great.

    3.
    Crown him the Lord of peace!
    whose power a scepter sways
    from pole to pole, that wars may cease,
    and all be prayer and praise.
    His reign shall know no end,
    and round his pierced feet
    fair flowers of paradise extend
    their fragrance ever sweet.

    4.
    Crown him the Lord of years;
    The potentate of time,
    Creator of the rolling spheres,
    Ineffably sublime!
    All hail, Redeemer, hail!
    For thou hast died for me;
    thy praise shall never, never fail

    And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

    2.
    The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
    And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.
    Wash all my sins away, wash all my sins away;
    And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

    3.
    Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power
    Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.
    Are saved, to sin no more, are saved, to sin no more;
    Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.

    4.
    E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
    And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;
    Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.

    5.
    Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, unworthy though I be,
    For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!
    A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me!
    For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!

    6.
    There in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy power to save,
    When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.
    Is ransomed from the grave, is ransomed from the grace;
    When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.

    Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,

    Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
    than all the angels heaven can boast.

    1.
    Jesus, these eyes have never seen, 
    That radiant form of Thine; 
    The veil of sense hangs dark between 
    Thy bless'd face and mine. 

    2.
    I see Thee not, I hear Thee not, 
    Yet art Thou oft with me; 
    And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot, 
    As where I meet with Thee. 

    3.
    Like some bright dream that comes unsought, 
    When slumbers o'er me roll, 
    Thine image ever fills my thought, 
    And charms my ravished soul. 

    4.
    Yet though I have not seen, and still 
    Must rest in faith alone, 
    I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will, 
    Unseen, but not unknown.

    1.
    Beyond the starry skies, 
    Far as th'eternal hills, 
    There, in the soundless world of light 
    Our great Redeemer dwells. 
    Around Him angels fair, 
    In countless armies shine; 
    And ever, in exalted lays, 
    They offer songs divine. 

    2.
    "Hail, Prince of life!" they cry, 
    "Whose unexampled love 
    Moved Thee to quit those glorious realms 
    And royalties above." 
    And when He stooped to earth, 
    And suffered rude disdain, 
    They cast their honors at His feet, 
    And waited in His train. 

    3.
    They saw Him on the cross, 
    While darkness veiled the skies; 
    And when He burst the gates of death, 
    They saw the Conqueror rise. 
    They thronged His chariot wheels, 
    And bore Him to His throne; 
    Then swept their golden harps and sang, 
    "That glorious work is done."

    There is a name I love to hear, 
    I love to sing its worth; 
    It sounds like music in mine ear, 
    The sweetest name on earth. 

    2.
    It tells me of a Saviour's love, 
    Who died to set me free; 
    It tells me of His precious blood, 
    The sinner's perfect plea. 

    3.
    It tells me of a Father's smile 
    Beaming upon His child; 
    It cheers me through this little while, 
    Through desert, waste, and wild. 

    4.
    Jesus, the name I love so well, 
    The name I love to hear; 
    No saint on earth its worth can tell, 
    No heart conceive how dear.

    This Name shall shed its fragrance still 
    Along this thorny road, 
    Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill 
    That leads me up to God.

    And His the solid ground. 

    3.
    Come, worship at His throne, 
    Come, bow before the Lord;

    Put in Thy sickle now; 
    Reap the great harvest of the earth;

    Robed in dreadful majesty!
    Those who set at nought and sold Him,

    Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing,
    Shall the true Mesiah see!

    When the solemn trump has sounded,
    Heaven and earth shall flee away;
    All who hate Him, must, confounded,

    Come to judgment! Come away!"

    Holy and true and good,
    Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,
    Her sighs and tears and blood?

    Earth has groaned with bloody wars, 
    And the hearts of men have feared. 

    2.
    Soon shall ocean's hoary deep, 
    Tossed with stronger tempests, rise; 
    Darker storms the mountain sweep, 
    Fiercer lightning rend the skies. 

    3.
    Dread alarms shall shake the proud, 
    Pale amazement, restless fear; 
    And, amid the thunder-cloud, 
    Shall the Judge of men appear.

    Deep are his counsels, and unknown, 
    But grace and truth support His throne; 
    Though gloomy clouds His ways surround, 
    Justice is their eternal ground. 

    3.
    In robes of judgment, lo, he comes! 
    Shakes the wide earth and cleaves the tombs; 
    Before him burns devouring fire; 
    The mountains melt, the seas retire. 

    4.
    His enemies, with wild dismay, 
    Fly from the sight, and shun the day; 
    Then lift your heads, ye saints, on high,

    That the kingdom now is near;

    Cannan's glorious heights arise; 
    Salem, too appears in grandeur, 
    Towering 'neath its sunlit skies. 

    4.
    Watchman, in the golden city, 
    Seated on His jasper throne, 
    Zion's King, arrayed in beauty, 
    Reigns in peace from zone to zone; 
    There, on sunlit hills and mountains, 
    Golden beams serenely glow; 
    Purling streams and crystal fountains, 
    On whose banks sweet flowerets blow. 

    5.
    Watchman, see, the land is nearing, 
    With its vernal fruits and flowers; 
    On, just yonder'O, how cheering! 
    Bloom forever Eden's bowers; 
    Hark, the choral strains are ringing, 
    Wafted on the balmy air; 
    See the millions, hear them singing, 
    Soon the pilgrims will be there.

    Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
    Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
    The Master's coming draweth near,
    Let every lamp be burning.

    2.
    Though thousands calmly slumber on,
    The last great message spurning,
    We'll rest our living faith upon
    His promise of returning.

    3.
    His word our lamp, His truth our guide,
    We cannot be mistaken;
    Though dangers rise on every side,
    We shall not be forsaken.

    4.
    Then let good works with faith appear,
    To help the world around us;
    Obedience bring the blessing near
    When faith has firmly bound us.

    1.
    Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
    Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
    Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
    Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.

    2.
    Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?
    How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?
    Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;
    Haste to receive Him descending the skies.

    3.
    Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
    Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
    Listen, 'tis nought but the chariot's loud rumbling;
    Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.

    4.
    Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!
    See how its glory is passing away;
    Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;
    Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.

    5.
    Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
    Watch for the glory of earth's coming King;
    Lo! o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;
    Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.

    Long for my Saviour I've been waiting, 
    Long time have watched by night and day;

    Here in this vale of sin and sorrow 
    I have been wandering many years, 
    Still looking for that happy morrow 
    When God would wipe away my tears. 

    3.
    Oftimes the tempter comes in power, 
    Fain then would lead my steps astray; 
    But when the clouds begin to lower, 
    Hope turns the darkness into day. 

    4.
    O it will be but little longer 
    I must these many woes endure; 
    Then let my faith and hope grow stronger; 
    My Father's promise still is sure.

    1.
    When Thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come, 
    To call Thy ransomed people home, 
    Shall I among them stand? 
    Shall such a worthless worm as I, 
    Who sometimes am afraid to die, 
    Be found at Thy right hand? 
    Be found at Thy right hand? 

    2.
    I love to meet among them now, 
    Before Thy gracious throne to bow, 
    Though weakest of them all; 
    Nor can I bear the piercing thought, 
    To have my worthless name left out, 
    When Thou for them shalt call, 
    When Thou for them shalt call. 

    3.
    Prevent, prevent it by Thy grace! 
    Be Thou, dear Lord, my hiding place 
    In that expected day. 
    Thy pardoning voice, O let me hear, 
    To still each unbelieving fear, 
    Nor let me fall, I pray, 
    Nor let me fall, I pray. 

    4.
    Let me among Thy saints be found, 
    Whene'er the Archangel's trump shall sound, 
    To see Thy smiling face;

    While heaven's resounding mansions ring 
    With shouts of endless grace,

    He's coming once again, 
    To set His people free; 
    That where He is, in glory bright, 
    His saints may also be. 
    Then lift the drooping head, 
    Look up, rejoice and sing; 
    He comes, in majesty sublime, 
    Salvation's glorious King! 

    2.
    The earth shall quake with fear, 
    The heavens shall flee away; 
    And where shall guilty man appear 
    In that tremendous day? 
    No refuge then is nigh, 
    No shelter from the blast; 
    The night of vengeance veils the sky 
    When mercy's day is past. 

    3.
    His eyes of living flame 
    The wicked shall devour; 
    No tongue will lightly speak the name 
    Of Jesus in that hour. 
    No scorn, no words of hate 
    For His meek followers then; 
    But prayers and tears that come too late 
    Will mark earth's mighty men.

    Angels tell their joy aloud, 
    Angels tell their joy aloud. 

    2.
    Hark! the trumpet's awful voice 
    Sounds abroad o'er sea and land; 
    Let His people now rejoice; 
    Their redemption is at hand, 
    Their redemption is at hand. 

    3.
    See, the Lord appears in view; 
    Heaven and earth before Him fly; 
    Rise, ye saints, He comes for you; 
    Rise, to meet Him in the sky, 
    Rise, to meet Him in the sky. 

    4.
    Go and dwell with Him above, 
    Where no foe can e'er molest; 
    Happy in the Saviour's love, 
    Ever blessing, ever blest, 
    Ever blessing, ever blest.

    The passing ages pray;

    Not less to God belong; 
    And for the everlasting right 
    The silent stars are strong. 

    3.
    And lo, already on the hills 
    The flags of dawn appear; 
    Gird up your loins, ye prophet souls,

    The day in whose clear-shining light 
    All wrong shall stand revealed, 
    When justice shall be throned in might, 
    And every hurt be healed. 

    5.
    When knowledge, hand in hand with peace, 
    Shall walk the earth abroad; 
    The day of perfect righteousness, 
    The promised day of God.

    When beauty gilds the eastern hills
    And life to joy awakes.

    2.
    Not as of old a little child,
    To bear and fight and die,
    But crowned with glory like the sun
    That lights the morning sky.

    3.
    O, brighter than that rising morn
    When Christ, victorious, rose
    And left the lonesome place death,
    Despite the rage of foes.

    Shall dawn upon our race
    They day when Christ in splendour comes,

    And light and beauty brings.

    1.
    Great God, what do I see and hear! 
    The end of things created! 
    The Judge of man I see appear 
    On clouds of glory seated; 
    The trumpet sounds; the graves restore 
    The dead which they contained before; 
    Prepare, my soul, to meet Him. 

    2.
    The dead in Christ shall first arise, 
    At the last trumpet's sounding' 
    Caught up to meet Him in the skies, 
    With joy their Lord surrounding; 
    No gloomy fears their souls dismay, 
    His presence sheds eternal day 
    On those prepared to meet Him. 

    3.
    But sinners filled with guilty fears, 
    Behold His wrath prevailing; 
    For they shall rise, and find their tears 
    And sighs are unavailing; 
    The day of grace is past and gone 
    Trembling they stand before the throne, 
    All unprepared to meet Him. 

    4.
    Great God! what did I see and hear! 
    The end of things created! 
    The Judge of man I see apprear 
    On clouds of glory seated; 
    Beneath His cross I view the day 
    When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
    And thus prepare to meet Him.

    Pouring out our rapture sweet 
    At Thine own allglorious feet. 

    3.
    Thou art coming; we are waiting 
    With a hope that cannot fail, 
    Asking not the day or hour, 
    Resting on Thy word of power, 
    Anchored safe within the veil. 
    Time appointed may be long, 
    But the vision must be sure; 
    Certainly must make us strong, 
    Joyful patience can endure.

    Wake, awake, for night is flying,
    The watchmen on the heights are crying,
    Awake, Jerusalem, arise!
    Midnight's solemn hour is tolling,
    His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,
    He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.
    Rise up with willing feet
    Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!
    Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,
    Speed forth to join the marriage rite.

    2.
    Zion hears the watchmen singing,
    Her heart with deep delight is springing,
    She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
    Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,
    In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;
    Her Star is risen, her Light is come!
    All hail, incarnate Lord,
    Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!
    We haste along, in pomp and song,
    And gladsome join the marriage throng.

    And men and angels sing before Thee,
    With harp and cymbal's clearest tone.
    By the pearly gates in wonder
    We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,
    That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.
    No vision ever brought,
    No ear hath ever caught,
    Such bliss and joy;
    We raise the song, we swell the throng,
    To praise Thee ages all along.

    Major Key: F

    1.
    We speak of the realms of the blest,
    That country so bright and so fair,
    And oft are its glories confessed-
    But what must it be to be there!
    We speak of its pathway of gold-
    Its walls decked with jewels so rare,
    Its wonders and pleasures untold-
    But what must it be to be there!

    2.
    We speak of its freedom of sin,
    From sorrow, temptation and care,
    From trials without and within
    But what must it be to be there!
    We speak of its service of love,
    Of the robes which the glorified wear,
    Of the church of the First Born above-
    But what must it be to be there!

    3.
    Our mourning is all at an end,
    When, raised by the life-giving word,
    We see the new city descend,
    Adorned as a bride for her Lord;
    The city so holy and clean,
    No sorrow can breathe in the air;
    No gloom of affliction or sin,
    No shadow of evil, is there.

    4.
    Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,
    For heaven my spirit prepare;
    And shortly I also shall know
    And feel what it is to be there.
    Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam,
    In glory celestial and fair,
    With saints and with angels at home,
    And Jesus Himself will be there.

    I long to behold Him arrayed

    The King in His beauty displayed, 
    His beauty of holiest love: 
    I languish, and sigh to be there, 
    Where Jesus hath fixed His abode; 
    O, when shall we meet in the air, 
    And fly to the mountain of God? 

    2.
    With Him, I on Zion shall stand, 
    For Jesus has spoken the word; 
    The breath of Immanuel's land, 
    Survey, by the side of my Lord! 
    But when, on Thy bosom reclined, 
    Thy face I am strengthened to see, 
    My fullness of rapture I find, 
    My heaven of heavens, in Thee. 

    3.
    How happy the people whose home 
    Is found in the city of God! 
    As pilgrims no more they shall roam, 
    Nor travel a dangerous road. 
    Physician divine, unto me 
    Thy soul-healing blessing now give, 
    And keep me while waiting for Thee, 
    And then to that city receive.

    Soon may the last glad song arise 
    Through all the millions of the skies; 
    That song of triumph which records 
    That all the earth is now the Lord's. 

    2.
    Let thrones and powers and kingdoms be 
    Obedient, mighty God, to Thee; 
    And over land and stream and main 
    Wave Thou the scepter of Thy reign.

    1.
    O what their joy and their glory must be, 
    Those endless sabbaths the blessed ones see; 
    Crown for the valiant, to weary ones rest; 
    God shall be all, and in all ever blest. 

    2.
    Truly, "Jerusalem" name we that shore, 
    "Vision of peace," that brings joy evermore; 
    Wish and fulfillment can severed be ne'er, 
    Nor the thing prayed for come short of the prayer. 

    3.
    We, where no trouble distraction can bring, 
    safely the anthems of Zion shall sing; 
    While for thy grace, Lord, their voices of praise 
    Thy blessed people shall evermore raise. 

    4.
    Now, in the meanwhile, with hearts raised on high, 
    We for that country must yearn and must sigh; 
    Seeking Jerusalem, dear native land, 
    Through our long exile on Babylon's strand. 

    5.
    Low before him with our praises we fall, 
    Of whom, and in whom, and through whom are all; 
    Of whom, the Father; and in whom, the Son;

    1.
    The Word, whose word can make me whole, 
    Has heard my spirit's cry, 
    And in the palace of the soul, 
    He dwells! my Lord and I!

    How holy must the temple be, 
    Where Jesus reigns within! 
    His precious blood, outpoured for me, 
    I trust to make me clean. 

    3.
    And he is come! To whom the praise, 
    The joy of heaven, belong; 
    My face I veil, my hands I raise, 
    And "silence is my song." 

    4.
    And now to me the gladdest thing 
    Be his sweet will alone; 
    Content, since I am with the King, 
    To make his choice my own. 

    5.
    He makes his palace in my soul, 
    He brings my spirit nigh; 
    Within my heart, 'neath his control 
    I dwell'my Lord and I!

    1.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    Come unto Me and rest;
    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
    Thy head upon My breast.
    I came to Jesus as I was,
    Weary and worn and sad;
    I found in Him a resting place,
    And He has made me glad.

    2.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    Behold, I freely give
    The living water; thirsty one,
    Stoop down and drink and live.
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life giving stream;
    My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
    And now I live in Him.

    3.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    I am this dark world's light;
    Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
    And all thy day be bright.
    I looked to Jesus, and I found
    In Him my star, my sun;
    And in that light of life I'll walk,
    Till trav'ling days are done.

## 227.  Behold the Saviour at the Door
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNju7k738c00SCVgBHJe4fXDEnQj02or/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Behold the Saviour at the door! 
    He gently knocks, has knocked before, 
    Has waited long, is waiting still; 
    You treat no other friend so ill. 

    2.
    He counsels thee to buy of him 
    Gold tried by fire, and raiment clean; 
    Anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see, 
    And put away thy stains from thee. 

    3.
    O, hear the faithful Witness' voice, 
    He offers now a final choice; 
    Thou art offensive, O lukewarm! 
    Therefore be zealous and reform. 

    4.
    His mission now is almost o'er, 
    Before the throne He'll plead no more; 
    The filthy must his filth retain, 
    He that is holy, so remain. 

    5.
    His locks with dews of night are wet, 
    But at thy heart he lingereth yet. 
    O wake, and open wide the door; 
    Bid thy Beloved wait no more. 

    6.
    Yea, bring him in, a welcome guest; 
    So shalt thou in his presence rest, 
    And in communion sweet and free, 
    Shalt sup with him and he with thee.
 
 

## 228.  Almost Persuaded

    1.
    Almost persuaded now to believe; 
    Almost persuaded Christ to receive. 
    Seems now some soul to say, 
    'Go, Spirit, go thy way, 
    Some more convenient day 
    On thee I'll call.' 

    2.
    Almost persuaded, come, come today; 
    Almost persuaded, turn not away. 
    Jesus invites you here, 
    Angels are lingering near, 
    Prayers rise from hearts so dear; 
    O wanderer, come! 

    3.
    Almost persuaded, harvest is past; 
    Almost persuaded, doom comes at last! 
    'Almost' cannot avail; 
    'Almost' is but to fail! 
    Sad, sad that bitter wail, 
    'Almost'but lost!'

    Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
    Seeking service in thy name; 
    All our youth and strength are thine, 
    Given to help thy work divine; 
    All our love and faith we bring, 
    They are thine, O heavenly King. 

    2.
    Lord of hosts, we ask thine aid, 
    Keep us ever unafraid; 
    Hold us loyal, hold us true 
    To the task we have to do; 
    Lead us on to victory, 
    We shall triumph praising thee. 

    3.
    Lord of all, we take our stand, 
    Giving help at thy command; 
    Eager, joyful, blithe, and strong, 
    Thrilled with love and filled with song; 
    Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
    Seeking service in thy name.

    1.
    I gave my life for thee, 
    My precious blood I shed, 
    That thou might'st ransom be, 
    And quickened from the dead; 
    I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
    What hast thou given for me? 
    I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
    What hast thou given for me? 

    2.
    My Fathers house of light, 
    My glory circled throne, 
    I left for earthly night, 
    For wanderings sad and lone; 
    I left, I left it all for thee, 
    Hast thou left aught for me? 
    I left, I left it all for thee, 
    Hast thou left aught for me? 

    3.
    I suffered much for thee, 
    More than thy tongue can tell, 
    Of bitterest agony, 
    To rescue thee from hell; 
    I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
    What hast thou borne for me? 
    I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
    What hast thou borne for me?

    1.
    O Jesus, thou art standing, 
    Outside the fast-closed door, 
    In lowly patience waiting 
    To pass the threshold o'er: 
    Shame on us, Christian brethren, 
    His Name and sign who bear, 
    O shame, thrice shame upon us, 
    To keep him standing there! 

    2.
    O Jesus, thou art knocking; 
    And lo, that hand is scarred, 
    And thorns thy brow encircle, 
    And tears thy face have marred. 
    O love that passeth knowledge, 
    So patiently to wait! 
    O sin that hath no equal, 
    So fast to bar the gate! 

    3.
    O Jesus, thou art pleading 
    In accents meek and low, 
    "I died for you, my children, 
    And will you treat me so?" 
    O Lord, with shame and sorrow 
    We open now the door; 
    Dear Saviour, enter, enter, 
    And leave us never more.

    1.
    Flee as a bird to your mountain, 
    Thou who art weary of sin; 
    Go to the clear flowing Fountain, 
    Where you may wash and be clean; 
    Fly, for th'avenger is near thee, 
    Call, and the Saviour will hear thee, 
    He on his bosom will bear thee; 
    O thou who art weary of sin, 
    O thou who art weary of sin. 

    2.
    He will protect thee forever, 
    Wipe every falling tear; 
    He will forsake thee, oh, never, 
    Sheltered so tenderly there! 
    Haste, then, the daylight is flying, 
    Spend not the moments in sighing, 
    Cease from your sorrow and crying, 
    The Saviour will wipe every tear, 
    Yes, Jesus will wipe every tear.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwhs5YwyPEkTWdeX88msEZwhStQTSBQY/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Jesus, to thee I now can fly, 
    On whom my help is laid; 
    Oppressed by sins, I lift my eye, 
    And see the shadows fade. 

    2.
    Believing on my Lord, I find 
    A sure and present aid; 
    On thee alone my constant mind 
    Be every moment stayed. 

    3.
    Whate'er in me seems wise, or good, 
    Or strong, I here disclaim; 
    I wash my garments in the blood 
    Of the atoning Lamb. 

    4.
    Jesus, my Strength, my Life, my Rest, 
    On thee will I depend, 
    Till summoned to the marriage-feast, 
    When faith in sight shall end.
 
 

## 234.  'Depth of Mercy!'

    1.
    Depth of mercy!'can there be 
    Mercy still reserved for me? 
    Can my God his wrath forbear? 
    Me, the chief of sinners, spare? 

    2.
    I have long withstood his grace, 
    Long provoked him to his face, 
    Would not hearken to his calls, 
    Grieved him by a thousand falls. 

    3.
    Now incline me to repent; 
    Let me now my sins lament; 
    Now my foul revolt deplore, 
    Weep, believe, and sin no more. 

    4.
    There for me the Saviour stands, 
    Shows his wounds and spreads his hands; 
    God is love! I know, I feel; 
    Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

    1.
    We stand in deep repentance, 
    Before thy throne of love; 
    O God of grace, forgive us, 
    The stain of guilt remove. 

    2.
    Behold us while with weeping 
    We lift our eyes to thee; 
    And, all our sins subduing, 
    Our Father, set us free! 

    3.
    O, shouldst thou from the fallen 
    Withhold thy grace to guide, 
    Forever we should wander, 
    From thee, and peace, aside. 

    4.
    Our souls'on thee we cast them, 
    Our only refuge thou! 
    Thy cheering words revive us, 
    When pressed with grief we bow. 

    5.
    Thou bearest the trusting spirit 
    Upon thy loving breast, 
    And givest all thy ransomed 
    A sweet, unending rest.

    1.
    Lord! at thy feet we humbly lie, 
    And knock at mercy's door; 
    With heavy heart and downcast eye 
    Thy favor we implore. 

    2.
    'Tis mercy, we implore; 
    We would thy pity move; 
    Thy grace is an exhaustless store, 
    And thou thyself art love. 

    3.
    O, for thine own, for Jesus' sake, 
    Our numerous sins forgive! 
    Thy grace our stony hearts can break; 
    Heal us, and bid us live.

    1.
    Jesus, full of all compassion, 
    Hear thy humble suppliant's cry; 
    Let me know thy great salvation; 
    See, I languish, faint and die. 
    Guilty, but with heart relenting, 
    Overwhelmed with helpless grief, 
    Prostrate at Thy feet repining, 
    Send, O send me quick relief. 

    2.
    Whither should my soul be flying, 
    But to him who comfort gives? 
    Whither, from the dread of dying, 
    But to him who ever lives? 
    While I view thee, wounded, grieving, 
    Breathless, on the cursed tree, 
    Fain I'd feel my heart believing 
    Thou didst suffer thus for me. 

    3.
    With thy righteousness and Spirit, 
    I am more than angels blessed; 
    Heir with thee, all things inherit' 
    Peace, and joy, and endless rest. 
    Saved! the deed shall spread new glory 
    Through the shining realms above; 
    Angels sing the pleasing story, 
    All enraptured with thy love.

    Major Key: A Flat

    1.
    Chief of sinners though I be,
    Jesus shed His blood for me;
    Died that I might live on high,
    Died that I might never die;
    As the brance is to the vine,
    I am His, and He is mine.

    2.
    O the height of Jesus' love!
    Higher than the heaven above,
    Deeper than the deepest sea,
    Lasting as eternity;
    Love that found me-wondrous thought!
    Found me when I sought Him not!

    3.
    Chief of sinners though I be,
    Christ is all in all to me;
    All my wants to Him are known,
    All my sorrows are His own;
    Safe with Him from earthly strife,
    He sustains the hidden life.

    1.
    Low at thy pierced feet, 
    Saviour of all, 
    Helpless and sorrowful 
    Prostrate I fall. 
    O cast me not away, 
    Forgive my sin this day, 
    Forgive my sin, 
    All, all my sin. 

    2.
    Sinful my life hath been, 
    Unclean, unclean; 
    All my iniquity 
    Thine eye hath seen; 
    Cleanse thou my soul today, 
    Wash all my sin away 
    In thine own blood, 
    In thine own blood. 

    3.
    By all thy grief and pain, 
    Forgive me now; 
    Before thy cross in shame 
    Lowly I bow. 
    Lord, let that blood of thine 
    Wash now this soul of mine; 
    Wash now this soul, 
    Wash now this soul. 

    4.
    Thou didst for me endure 
    Dread Calvary; 
    Sin's punishment and shame 
    All, all for me. 
    On thee my guilt was laid, 
    By thee my dept was paid, 
    To set me free, 
    To set me free. 

    5.
    Lord, I accept thee now, 
    Accept thou me; 
    I have delayed too long, 
    And grieved thee. 
    By all thy love to me, 
    I give myself to thee; 
    Make me thine own, 
    All, all thine own.

    1.
    Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive! 
    Let a repenting sinner live; 
    Are not thy mercies large and free? 
    May not the guilty trust in thee? 

    2.
    My crimes, though great, do not surpass 
    The power and glory of thy grace; 
    O, wash my soul from every sin, 
    And make my guilty conscience clean! 

    3.
    My lips with shame my sins confess, 
    Against thy law, against thy grace; 
    Lord, should thy judgment be severe, 
    I am condemned, but thou art clear. 

    4.
    Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, 
    Whose hope, still hovering'round thy Word, 
    Would light on some sweet promise there, 
    Some sure support against despair.

    1.
    From every stormy wind that blows, 
    From every swelling tide of woes, 
    There is a calm, a sure retreat; 
    'Tis found beneath the mercy seat. 

    2.
    There is a place where Jesus sheds 
    The oil of gladness on our heads, 
    A place than all besides more sweet; 
    It is the blood-bought mercy seat. 

    3.
    There is a scene where spirits blend, 
    Where friend holds fellowship with friend; 
    Though sundered far, by faith they meet 
    Around one common mercy seat. 

    4.
    There, there, on angel's wings we soar, 
    And earthly cares molest no more, 
    And heaven comes down our souls to greet, 
    And glory crowns the mercy seat. 

    5.
    Ah! whither should we flee for aid, 
    When tempted, desolate dismayed? 
    Or how the hosts of sin defeat, 
    Had suffering saints no mercy seat?

    'Tis by the faith of joys to come 
    We walk through deserts dark as night; 
    Till we arrive at Heaven our home, 
    Truth is our guide, and faith our light. 

    2.
    The want of sight she well supplies, 
    She makes the pearly gates appear; 
    Far into distant worlds she pries, 
    And brings eternal glories near. 

    3.
    Though lions roar, and tempests blow, 
    And rocks and dangers fill the way, 
    With joy we tread the desert through, 
    While faith inspires a heavenly ray.

    Come, O thou Traveler unknown, 
    Whom still I hold but cannot see; 
    My company before is gone, 
    And I am left alone with thee; 
    With thee all night I mean to stay, 
    And wrestle till the break of day. 

    2.
    I need not tell thee who I am, 
    My sin and misery declare; 
    Thyself hast called me by my name, 
    Look on thy hands, and read it there; 
    But who, I ask thee, who art thou? 
    Tell me thy name, and tell me now. 

    3.
    In vain thou strugglest to get free; 
    I never will unloose my hold; 
    Art thou the Man that died for me? 
    The secret of thy love unfold; 
    Clinging, I will not let thee go, 
    Till I thy name, thy nature know.

    O could our thoughts and wishes fly, 
    Above these gloomy shades, 
    To those bright worlds beyond the sky, 
    Where sorrow ne'er invades! 

    2.
    There, joys unseen by mortal eyes, 
    Or reason's feeble ray, 
    In ever-blooming prospect rise, 
    Exposed to no decay. 

    3.
    Lord, send a beam of light divine, 
    To guide our upward aim; 
    With one reviving look of Thine, 
    Our languid hearts inflame. 

    4.
    O then, on faith's sublimest wing, 
    Our ardent souls shall rise 
    To those bright scenes where pleasures spring 
    Immortal in the skies.

    1.
    O for a faith that will not shrink, 
    Though pressed by many a foe; 
    That will not tremble on the brink of poverty, 
    Of poverty or woe; 
    Of poverty or woe; 

    2.
    That will not murmur or complain 
    Beneath the chastening rod, 
    But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain 
    Can lean upon its God; 
    Can lean upon its God. 

    3.
    A faith that shines more bright and clear 
    When tempests rage without; 
    That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear, 
    In darkness feels no doubt; 
    In darkness feels no doubt. 

    4.
    That bears unmoved the world's dread frown, 
    Nor heeds its scornful smile; 
    That sin's wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown, 
    Nor its soft arts beguile; 
    Nor its soft arts beguile. 

    5.
    Lord, give me such a faith as this, 
    And then, whate'er may come 
    I'll taste, e'en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss 
    Of an eternal home; 
    Of an eternal home.

    My zeal inspire!
    As Thou hast died for me,
    O may my love to Thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,
    A living fire!

    3.
    While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
    Be Thou my guide;

    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray

    Toil on a little longer here, 
    For thy reward awaits above, 
    Nor droop in sadness or in fear 
    Beneath the rod that's sent in love; 
    The deeper wound our spirits feel, 
    The sweeter heaven's balm to heal. 

    2.
    Faith lifts the veil before our eyes, 
    And bids us view a happier clime, 
    Where verdant fields in beauty rise, 
    Beyond the withering blasts of time; 
    And brings the blissful moment near, 
    When we in glory shall appear. 

    3.
    What glory then shall fill the soul, 
    When parted friends again shall meet, 
    Beyond the reach of death's control, 
    And cast their crowns at Jesus' feet; 
    His matchless love and grace adore, 
    And never taste of sorrow more. 

    4.
    Then let us hope; 'tis not in vain; 
    Though moistened by our grief the soil, 
    The harvest brings us joy for pain, 
    The rest repays the weary toil; 
    For they shall reap who sow in tears, 
    Rich gladness through eternal years.

    'Tis my happiness below 
    Not to live without the cross; 
    But the Saviour's power to know, 
    Sanctifying every loss. 

    2.
    Trials must and will befall; 
    But with humble faith to see 
    Love inscribed upon them all' 
    This is happiness to me. 

    3.
    Did I meet no trials here, 
    No chastisement by the way, 
    Might I not with reason fear 
    I should prove a castaway?

    Trials make the promise sweet; 
    Trials give new life to prayer; 
    Trials bring me to his feet, 
    Lay me low, and keep me there.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xquG%2D3wpURnMzgVIi4Qdy6wJ8DD2NFPm/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I ask not, Lord, for less to bear 
    Here in the narrow way, 
    But that I may thy blessing share 
    In all I do or say, 
    In all I do or say. 

    2.
    Through whatsoe'er my path shall lie, 
    With patience may I run; 
    With filial trust my heart reply, 
    "Thy will, O God, be done. 
    Thy will, O God, be done." 

    3.
    With Thee to lead, I will not fear 
    In scenes with dangers rife, 
    While still thy cheering voice I hear, 
    "I am the way, the life, 
    I am the way, the life". 

    4.
    Thou art the refuge of my soul, 
    My hope when comforts flee, 
    My strength while life's rough billows roll, 
    My joy eternally, 
    My joy eternally. 

    5.
    Then help me to improve with care, 
    These precious moments given; 
    For they a faithful record bear, 
    Of good or ill, to heaven, 
    Of good or ill, to heaven. 

    6.
    And in Thine arms of love enfold 
    Me from the tempter's snare; 
    And in the book of life enrolled, 
    Be my name written there, 
    Be my name written there.

    My spirit on thy care, 
    Blest Saviour, I recline; 
    Thou wilt not leave me to despair, 
    For Thou art love divine. 

    2.
    In thee I place my trust, 
    On thee I calmly rest; 
    I know thee good, I know thee just, 
    And count thy choice the best. 

    3.
    Whate'er events betide, 
    Thy will they all perform; 
    Safe in Thy breast my head I hide, 
    Nor fear the coming storm.

    It must be good for me, 
    Secure of having Thee in all,

    1.
    The tempter to my soul hath said, 
    "There is no help in God for thee;" 
    Lord! lift thou up thy servant's head; 
    My glory, shield, and solace be. 

    2.
    Thus to the Lord I raised my cry; 
    He heard me from his holy hill; 
    At his command the waves rolled by; 
    He beckoned, and the winds were still. 

    3.
    I laid me down and slept, I woke' 
    Thou, Lord, my spirit didst sustain; 
    Bright, from the east, the morning broke; 
    Thy comforts rose on me again. 

    4.
    I will not fear, though armed throngs 
    Compass my steps in all their wrath; 
    Salvation to the Lord belongs; 
    His presence guards His people's path.
 
 

## 254.  Sometimes a Light Surprises
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr8bA7vVXFAvp9_VYzSL8H8U58VNBkL9/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Sometimes a light surprises 
    The Christian while he sings; 
    It is the Lord, who rises 
    With healing in his wings; 
    When comforts are declining, 
    He grants the soul again 
    A season of clear shining, 
    To cheer it after rain. 

    2.
    In holy contemplation 
    We sweetly then pursue 
    The theme of God's salvation, 
    And find it ever new; 
    Set free from present sorrow, 
    We cheerfully can say, 
    Let the unknown tomorrow 
    Bring with it what it may. 

    3.
    Children of God lack nothing, 
    His promise bears them through; 
    Who gives the lilies clothing, 
    Will clothe his people too; 
    Beneath the spreading heavens 
    No creature but is fed, 
    And he who feeds the ravens 
    Will give his children bread. 

    5.
    Though vine nor fig tree neither 
    Their wonted fruit should bear, 
    Though all the fields should wither, 
    Nor flocks nor herds be there; 
    Yet God the same abiding, 
    His praise shall tune my voice, 
    For while in Him confiding, 
    I cannot but rejoice.

    Fear not, I am with thee; O be not dismayed; 
    For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid; 
    I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, 
    Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand, 
    Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. 

    3.
    When through deep waters I call thee to go, 
    The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow; 
    For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
    And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress, 
    And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. 

    4.
    When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie, 
    My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply; 
    The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design 
    Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine, 
    Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. 

    5.
    The soul that on Jesus doth lean for respose, 
    I will not, I will not depart to his foes; 
    That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, 
    I'll never, no never, no never forsake, 
    I'll never, no never, no never forsake.

    A mighty fortress is our God,
    A bulwark never failing;
    Our helper He amid the flood
    Of mortal ills prevaling.
    For still our ancient foe
    Doth seek to work us woe;
    His craft and power are great,
    And armed with cruel hate,
    On earth is not his equal.

    2.
    Did we in our own strength confide,
    Our striving would be losing,
    Were not the right man on our side,
    The man of God's own choosing.
    Dost ask who that may be?
    Christ Jesus, it is he;
    Lord Sabbaoth, His name,
    From age to age the same,
    And He must win the battle.

    3.
    And though this world, with devils filled,
    Should threaten to undo us,
    We will not fear, for God hath willed
    His truth to triumph through us.
    The Prince of Darkness grim,
    We tremble not for him;
    His rage we can endure,
    For lo, his doom is sure;
    One little word shall fell him.

    4.
    That word above all earthly powers,
    No thanks to them, abideth;
    The Spirit and the gifts are ours,
    Thru him who with us sideth.
    Let goods and kindred go,
    This mortal life also;
    The body they may kill;
    God's truth abideth still;
    His kingdom is forever.

    Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father's smiles are thine;
    Think that Jesus died to win thee, child of heaven, canst thou repine?

    4.
    Haste then on from grace to glory, armed by faith, and winged by prayer,
    Heaven's eternal day's before thee, God's own hand shall guide thee there.
    Soon shall close thy earthly mission, soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
    Hope soon change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
 
 

## 268.  'Blessed Jesus, Meek and Lowly'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wjFseGvlWzEWHCb_OqgLvVIyxG5Fo2vc/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Blessed Jesus, meek and lowly, 
    With us here take thine abode; 
    We would fain like thee be holy, 
    Humbly walking with our God. 
    We would thy sweet Spirit cherish, 
    Welcome in our hearts thy stay; 
    Lest without thine aid we perish, 
    O, abide with us, we pray! 

    2.
    Guide us in the path to heaven, 
    Rugged though that path may be; 
    Let each bitter cup that's given, 
    Serve to draw us nearer thee. 
    In thy footsteps traced before us, 
    There we see earth's scorn and frown; 
    There is suffering ere the glory, 
    There's a cross before the crown. 

    3.
    In thy vineyard let us labor, 
    Of thy goodness let us tell; 
    All is ill without thy favor, 
    With thy presence all is well. 
    While the evening shadows gather, 
    Through this dreary night of tears, 
    Tarry with us, O our Saviour, 
    Till the morning light appears. 

    4.
    Then with thee may we forever 
    Reign with all the good and blest, 
    Where no sin from thee can sever, 
    Where the weary are at rest; 
    There to praise the matchless Giver, 
    There with angels to adore 
    Him who did through grace deliver 
    Us from death forevermore.

    Strengthen me with power divine; 
    By thy cords of love that bound me,

    A rest upon the way,
    From the burning of the noontide heat,
    And the burden of the day.

    2.
    Upon that cross of Jesus
    Mine eye at times can see
    The very dying form of One
    Who suffered there for me;
    And from my stricken heart with tears
    Two wonders I confess:
    The wonders of redeeming love
    And my unworthiness.

    3.
    I take, O cross, thy shadow
    For my abiding place;
    I ask no other sunshine than
    The sunshine of His face;
    Content to let the world go by,
    To know no gain nor loss,
    My sinful self my only shame,
    My glory all the cross.

    Cease, restless will! thy lonely strife resign! 
    I know too well how little strength is mine;

    I strive no more; I give myself to Thee.

    1.
    O Lamb of God! still keep me 
    Near to Thy wounded side; 
    'Tis only there in safely 
    And peace I can abide! 
    What foes and snares surround me, 
    What doubts and fears within! 
    The grace that sought and found me, 
    Alone can keep me clean. 

    2.
    'Tis only in Thee hiding 
    I know my life secure' 
    Only in Thee abiding, 
    The conflict can endure. 
    Thine arm the victory gaineth 
    O'er every hateful foe; 
    Thy love my heart sustaineth 
    In all its care and woe. 

    3.
    Soon shall my eyes behold Thee, 
    With rapture, face to face; 
    One half hath not been told me 
    Of all Thy power and grace. 
    Thy beauty, Lord, and glory, 
    The wonders of Thy love, 
    Shall be the endless story 
    Of all the saints above.

    Major Key: D

    1.
    Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
    Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
    Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
    Call for songs of loudest praise.
    Teach me ever to adore Thee,
    May I still Thy goodness prove,
    While the hope of endless glory
    Fills my heart with joy and love.

    2.
    Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
    Hither by Thy help I've come;
    And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
    Safely to arrive at home.
    Jesus sought me when a stranger,
    Wandering from the fold of God;
    He, to rescue me from danger,
    Interposed His precious blood.

    3.
    O, to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I'm constrained to be!
    Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
    Bind me closer still to Thee.
    Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
    Prone to leave the God I love;
    Here's my heart--O, take and seal it,
    Seal it for Thy courts above.
 
 

## 292.  O How Happy Are They
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1us3snt4bGHrH1bDJmSdU5aLtw5wVgonU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O how happy are they 
    Who their Saviour obey, 
    And have laid up their treasure above! 
    Tongue can never express 
    The sweet comfort and peace 
    Of a soul in its earliest love. 

    2.
    That sweet comfort is mine, 
    Since the favor divine 
    I received through the blood of the Lamb; 
    Since my heart first believed. 
    What a joy I've received, 
    What a heaven in Jesus' dear name! 

    3.
    'Tis a heaven below 
    My Redeemer to know; 
    And the angels can do nothing more 
    Than to fall at His feet, 
    And the story repeat, 
    And the Lover of sinners adore. 

    4.
    Jesus all the day long 
    Is my joy and my song; 
    O that all to this refuge might fly! 
    He hath loved me, indeed, 
    He did suffer and bleed, 
    To redeem such a rebel as I. 

    5.
    On the wings of His love, 
    I am carried above 
    All my sin, and temptation, and pain; 
    O, that all would believe, 
    And by sin never grieve, 
    And thus cause Him to suffer again.

    Awake! Jerusalem, awake! 
    No longer in thy sins lie down; 
    The garment of salvation take, 
    Thy beauty and thy strength put on. 

    2.
    Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight, 
    And hides the promise from thine eyes: 
    Arise, and struggle into light; 
    The great Deliverer calls, Arise! 

    3.
    Shake off the bands of sad despair; 
    Zion, assert thy liberty; 
    Look up, thy broken heart prepare, 
    And God shall set the captive free. 

    4.
    Vessels of mercy, sons of grace, 
    Be purged from every sinful slain; 
    Be like your Lord, His word embrace, 
    Nor bear His hallowed name in vain.

    Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
    Behold the King of glory waits;
    The King of kings is drawing near,
    The Savior of the world is here.

    2.
    The Lord is just, a helper tried;
    Mercy is ever at His side;
    His kingly crowns is holiness,
    His scepter, pity in distress.

    3.
    O blest the land, the city blest,
    Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
    O happy hearts and happy homes
    To whom this King in triumph comes!

    4.
    Fling wide the portals of your heart;
    Make it a temple, set apart
    From earthly use for heaven's employ,
    Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.

    5.
    Redeemer, come; I open wide
    My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.
    Let me Thy inner presence feel,
    Thy grace and love in me reveal.
 
 

## 295.  Amazing Grace
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uumGBTyfEpYzNDt%2DpdIuvM1AhMTMQNLs/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
    that saved a wretch like me!
    I once was lost, but now am found;
    was blind, but now I see.

    2.
    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    and grace my fears relieved;
    how precious did that grace appear
    the hour I first believed.

    3.
    The Lord has promised good to me,
    his word my hope secures;
    he will my shield and portion be,
    as long as life endures.

    4.
    Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
    I have already come;
    'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
    and grace will lead me home.

    5.
    When we've been there ten thousand years,
    bright shining as the sun,
    we've no less days to sing God's praise
    than when we first begun.
 
 

## 296.  We Sing the Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEhSmE2KvjTYfar%2DQUFEoeNrKEved0zU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We sing the praise of Him who died, 
    Of Him who died upon the cross; 
    The sinner's hope let men deride; 
    For this we count the world but loss. 

    2.
    Inscribed upon the cross we see 
    In shining letters, "God is love;" 
    He bears our sins upon the tree: 
    He brings us mercy from above. 

    3.
    The cross'it takes our guilt away; 
    It holds the fainting spirit up; 
    It cheers with hope the gloomy day, 
    And sweetens every bitter cup. 

    4.
    It makes the coward spirit brave, 
    And nerves the feeble arm for fight; 
    It takes the terror from the grabe, 
    And gilds the bed of death with light. 

    5.
    The balm of life, the cure of woe, 
    The measure and the pledge of love, 
    The sinner's refuge here below, 
    The angels' theme in heaven above.
 
 

## 297.  Let Heaven Highest Praises Bring
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAZouDCXkT4eaUmFLkohAQ3cCIrjCk1P/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Let heaven highest praises bring, 
    And earth her songs of gladness sing, 
    To magnify our Saviour, King, 
    Who bought us by His precious blood. 

    2.
    May all the suffering Thou hast borne, 
    The bleeding side, the cruel thorn, 
    Our hearts to Thee in sorrow turn, 
    And lead us safely home to God. 

    3.
    By scourgings, spittings, stripes, and scars, 
    Jesus, the Maker of the stars, 
    The gates of heaven for us unbars, 
    And bids us freely enter in. 

    4.
    Fill us, O Saviour, with Thy love, 
    Grant us eternal joys above, 
    Oh, faithful to Thy promise prove, 
    And cleanse us from our every sin.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utHNz09rcvk9wsIUQ9f6v4wKpVj0Q3nI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark, my soul! it is the Lord; 
    'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word; 
    Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee, 
    "Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

    2.
    "Mine is an unchanging love, 
    Higher than the heights above; 
    Deeper than the depths beneath, 
    Free and faithful, strong as death." 

    3.
    "Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
    When the work of grace is done; 
    Partner of My throne shalt be! 
    Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

    4.
    Lord, it is my chief complaint 
    That my love is weak and faint; 
    Yet I love Thee and adore; 
    O for grace to love more!
 
 

## 299.  There Is a Land of Pure Delight
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBS8HvpFrbwB1pTk6IpHZkX76c3om_Ew/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a land of pure delight, 
    Where saints immortal reign, 
    Infinite day excludes the night, 
    And pleasures banish pain. 
    There everlasting spring abides, 
    And never withering flowers, 
    And but a little space divides 
    This heav'nly land from ours. 

    2.
    O could we make our doubts remove, 
    Those gloomy thoughts that rise, 
    And see the Canaan that we love, 
    With unbeclouded eyes; 
    Could we but climb where Moses stood, 
    And view the landscape o'er, 
    Not all this world's pretended good 
    Could ever charm us more.

    1.
    Jerusalem the golden, 
    With milk and honey blest, 
    Beneath thy contemplation 
    Sink heart and voice oppressed. 
    I know not, O I know not 
    What holy joys are there; 
    What radiancy of glory, 
    What bliss beyond compare. 

    2.
    They stand, those hall of Zion, 
    All jubilant with song, 
    And bright with many an angel, 
    And all the martyr throng. 
    The Prince is ever in them, 
    The daylight is serene; 
    The pastures of the blessed 
    Are deck in glorious sheen. 

    3.
    There is the throne of David, 
    And there, from care released, 
    The song of them that triumph, 
    The shout of them that feast; 
    And they who, with their Leader, 
    Have conquered in the fight, 
    Forever and forever 
    Are clad in robes of white. 

    4.
    O sweet and blessed country, 
    The home of God's elect! 
    O sweet and blessed country, 
    That eager hearts expect! 
    Jesus, in mercy bring us 
    To that dear land of rest; 
    Who art, with God the Father, 
    And Spirit, ever blest.

    1.
    There is a happy land, 
    Far, far away, 
    Where saints in glory stand, 
    Bright, bright as day. 
    O! how they sweetly sing, 
    "Worthy is our Saviour King;" 
    Loud let His praises ring, 
    Praise, praise for aye. 

    2.
    Come to that happy land 
    Come, come away; 
    Why will ye doubting stand? 
    Why still delay? 
    O! we shall happy be, 
    From all sin and sorrow free; 
    Lord, we shall live with Thee, 
    Blest, blest for aye. 

    3.
    Bright in that happy land 
    Beams every eye; 
    Kept by a Father's hand, 
    Love cannot die; 
    Then shall Thy kingdom come, 
    Saints have a glorious home; 
    And, brighter than the sun, 
    Reign, reign for aye.

    Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! 
    Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain! 
    Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning; 
    Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign. 

    2.
    Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing; 
    Streams ever copious are gliding along; 
    Loud, from the mountaintops echoes are ringing; 
    Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song. 

    3.
    See, the dead risen from land and from ocean; 
    Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high; 
    Fallen the engines of war and commotion, 
    Shouts of salvation are rending the sky. 
    Reign, reign for aye.

    Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the daystar of gladness, 
    Arise for the night of thy sorrow is o'er. 
    Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness; 
    Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more. 

    2.
    Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them, 
    And scattered their legions, was mightier far; 
    They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them; 
    In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war. 
    Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them, 
    And scattered their legions, was mightier far. 

    3.
    Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee, 
    Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be.

    Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be.
 
 

## 304.  Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBhxGiJEQyul2N3gh1gYX4v%2DW9ldqSJ5/edit?mode=html)



    Major Key: E Flat

    1.
    Glorious things of thee are spoken,
    Zion, city of our God;
    He whose word cannot be broken
    Formed thee for His own abode;
    On the Rock of Ages founded,
    What can shake thy sure repose?
    With salvation's wall surrounded,
    Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

    2.
    See the streams of living waters
    Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters,
    And all fear and want remove;
    Who can faint when such a river
    Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
    Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
    Never fails from age to age.

    3.
    Round each habitation hovering,
    See the cloud and fire appear
    For a glory and a covering,
    Showing that the Lord is near;
    Blest inhabitants of Zion,
    Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
    Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
    Makes them kings and priests to God.

    4.
    Savior, if of Zion's city
    I, through grace, a member am,
    Let the world deride or pity,
    I will glory in Thy name;
    Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
    All his boasted pomp and show;
    Solid joys and lasting treasure
    None but Zion's children know.

    We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;
    We have heard, and our hearts are glad;
    For we were a lonely pilgrim band,
    And weary, and worn, and sad.
    They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-
    No longer are homeless ones;
    And we know that the goodly land is fair,
    Where life's pure river runs.

    2.
    They say green fields are waving there,
    That never a blight shall know;
    And the deserts wild are blooming fair,
    And the roses of Sharon grow.
    There are lovely birds in the bowers green,
    Their songs are blithe and sweet;
    And their warblings, gushing ever new,
    The angels' harpings greet.

    3.
    We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,
    And the silvery band in white;
    Of the city fair, with pearly gates,
    All radiant with light.
    We have heard of the angels there, and saints,
    With their harps of gold, how they sing;
    Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,
    Of the leaves that healing bring.

    4.
    The King of that country, He is fair,
    He's the joy and light of the place;
    In His beauty we shall behold Him there,
    And bask in His smiling face,
    We'll be there, we'll be there in a little while,
    We'll join the pure and the blest;
    We'll have the palm, the robe, the crown,
    And forever be at rest.

    And all its tribes were made!
    O joy, for all its former woes
    A thousandfold repaid!

    3.
    O then what raptured greetings
    On Canaan's happy shore!
    What knitting severed friendship where

    Orphans no longer fatherless,
    Nor widows desolate.

    4.
    Bring near Thy great salvation,
    Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
    Fill up the roll of Thine elect,

    Thine exiles long for home;

    And when the bright celestial train. 
    From highest heaven to earth shall come; 
    Then with my Lord I'll rise, and reign 
    Forever in that happy home.

    All things both great and small; 
    For the dear God who loveth us,

    2.
    Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 
    The falling of a tear,

    He prayeth best who loveth best 
    All things both great and small; 
    For the dear God who loveth us, 
    He made and loveth all.

    Prayer is the simplest form of speech 
    That infant lips can try; 
    Prayer the sublimest strains that reach 
    The Majesty on high. 
    He prayeth best who loveth best 
    All things both great and small; 
    For the dear God who loveth us, 
    He made and loveth all. 

    4.
    Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 
    The Christian's native air, 
    His watchword at the gates of death; 
    He enters heaven with prayer. 
    O Thou, by whom we come to God, 
    The life, the truth, the way, 
    The path of prayer Thyself hast trod; 
    Lord, teach us how to pray.

## 335.  Alone With Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FmH5JppJaAjcnFR1K6i3fek8r03RsPv9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Alone with Thee, my Godin prayer 
    Fain would I from the world repair, 
    AAnd leave the sordid things of life 
    To rest from toil, to cease from strife. 

    2.
    Alone with Thee when breaks the morn, 
    When joyous youth and hope are born. 
    My Friend and Guardian from my birth, 
    Guide all my wanderings trough this earth. 

    3.
    Alone with Thee at blazing noon, 
    E'en youth and strength pass swift and soon. 
    I would not wait till comes the night 
    But yield to Thee my man-hood's might. 

    4.
    Alone with Thee when night is nigh 
    And darkness steals across the sky. 
    With Thee I'd brave death's chilling tide 
    And stand at last on Canaan's side.

    1.
    Come in, O come! the door stands open now; 
    I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou; 
    The sun has set long since; the storms begin; 
    'Tis time for Thee, my Saviour, O come in! 

    2.
    Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room; 
    The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom, 
    The table empty stands, the couch undressed; 
    Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest! 

    3.
    Yet welcome and tonight; this doleful scene 
    Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in; 
    This dark confusion e'en at once demands 
    Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ordering hands. 

    4.
    I seek no more to alter things, or mend, 
    Before the coming of so great a Friend; 
    All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill 
    Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still 

    5.
    Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart 
    A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art; 
    To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin: 
    Come, all Thyself, yea, come, Lord Jesus, in!

    Stand still and see! yea, see, today, 
    New wonders of redeeming grace' 
    The mighty Potter molds the clay 
    Again within this hallowed place, 
    Till through the human, the Divine 
    Is seen once more to move and shine. 

    2.
    Here "commune with thine heart, be still!" 
    Search all the secret stores of years, 
    Till silence, now unbearable' 
    Self, self-betrayed with blinding tears; 
    Then fall at Jesus' feet, and say, 
    Thou can'st, Thou shalt, cleanse all today! 

    3.
    "Be still, and know that I am God!" 
    Peace, wounded conscience, heaving breast! 
    Christ's pierced hand bears alone the rod, 
    His cloud transfigures and brings rest. 
    Take, Lord, Thy power, reign, great I AM, 
    O'er shadowing Guest, all-conquering Lamb! 

    4.
    Then in the hush of this fair tent, 
    And solemn stillness of this hour, 
    Three thousand souls before Thee bent. 
    Break forth, O Holy Ghost, in power; 
    Sweep through, Thou Wind of God, sweep through; 
    Once more cleanse, consecrate, renew!

    One precious boon, O Lord, I seek, 
    While tossed upon life's billowy sea; 
    To hear a voice within me speak, 
    "Thy Saviour is well pleased with thee." 

    2.
    Earth's scoffs and scorn well pleased I'll bear, 
    Nor mourn though underfoot I'm trod, 
    If day by day I may but share 
    Thine approbation, O my God! 

    3.
    The friends I love may turn from me, 
    Their words unkind may pierce me through; 
    But this my daily prayer shall be, 
    "Forgive; they know not what they do." 

    4.
    Let me but know, wher-e'er I roam, 
    That I am doing Jesus' will; 
    And though I've neither friends nor home, 
    My heart shall glow with gladness still. 

    5.
    To that bright, blest, immortal morn, 
    By holy prophets long foretold, 
    My eager, longing eyes I turn, 
    And soon its glories shall behold. 

    6.
    Then all the scoffs and scorn I've borne 
    For His dear sake who died for me, 
    To everlasting joys will turn, 
    In glorious immortality.

    Walk in the light! and e'en the tomb 
    No fearful shade shall wear; 
    Glory shall chase away its gloom, 
    For Christ hath conquered there, 
    For Christ hath conquered there. 

    4.
    Walk in the light! and thine shall be 
    A path, though thorny, bright; 
    For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee, 
    And God Himself is light, 
    And God Himself is light.

    In childhood, manhood, age, and death,

    If I find Him, if I follow, 
    What my portion here? 
    "Many a sorrow, many a labor, 
    Many a tear." 

    5.

    What hath He at last? 
    "Sorrow vanquished, labor ended, 
    Jordan passed. " 

    6.
    If I ask Him to receive me, 
    Will He say me nay? 
    "Not till earth and not till heaven 
    Pass away." 

    7.
    Finding, following, keeping, struggling, 
    Is He sure to bless? 
    "Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs, 
    Answer, Yes."

    2.
    In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you, 
    Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew; 
    Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought, 
    Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought? 

    3.
    In the field of Jesus there is work for you; 
    Such as even angels might rejoice to do; 
    Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand, 
    While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand? 

    4.
    In the home of Jesus there's a place for you; 
    Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too; 
    Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace, 
    If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?

    Lord, give a pure and loving heart
    To feel and own the love Thou art.

    We have not served Thee as we ought;
    Alas! the duties left undone,
    The work with little fervor wrought,

    For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.

    When shall we know Thee as we ought,
    And fear, and love, and serve aright!

    And all Thy armies shine
    In robes of victory through the skies,
    The glory shall be Thine

    Hide within thy heart His word; Watch and pray!

    We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time,
    In an age on ages telling-- To be living is sublime.
    Hark! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray;
    Hark! what soundeth? Is creation Groaning for her latter day?

    2.
    Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, Nerve thee for the battlefield;
    Bear the helmet of salvation, And the mighty gospel shield;
    Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, Take the Spirit's sword in hand;
    Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, In Jehovah's strength to stand.

    3.
    And the prince of evil spirits, Great deceiver of the world!
    He who at the blessed Jesus Once his deadly weapons hurled,
    Cometh with unwonted power, Knowing that his reign will cease
    When the kingdom shall be given To the mighty Prince of Peace.

    4.
    Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, Cease not till the victory's won;
    Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, Servant of the Lord, well done!
    He, alone, who thus is faithful, Who abideth to the end,
    Hath the promise, in the kingdom An eternity to spend.

    1.
    The Son of God goes forth to war, 
    A kingly crown to gain; 
    His blood red banner streams afar: 
    Who follows in His train? 
    Who best can drink his cup of woe, 
    Triumphant over pain, 
    Who patient bears his cross below, 
    He follows in His train. 

    2.
    That martyr first, whose eagle eye 
    Could pierce beyond the grave; 
    Who saw his Master in the sky, 
    And called on Him to save. 
    Like Him, with pardon on His tongue, 
    In midst of mortal pain, 
    He prayed for them that did the wrong: 
    Who follows in His train? 

    3.
    A glorious band, the chosen few 
    On whom the Spirit came; 
    Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew, 
    And mocked the cross and flame. 
    They met the tyrant's brandished steel, 
    The lion's gory mane; 
    They bowed their necks the stroke to feel: 
    Who follows in their train? 

    4.
    A noble army, men and boys, 
    The matron and the maid, 
    Around the Savior's throne rejoice, 
    In robes of light arrayed. 
    They climbed the steep ascent of Heaven, 
    Through peril, toil and pain; 
    O God, to us may grace be given, 
    To follow in their train.

    O Master! When Thou Callest 
    No heart may dare refuse;

    Our dearest-all are Thine; 
    Thou who for each one carest, 
    We hail Thy love's design. 

    4.
    They who go forth to serve Thee, 
    We, too, who serve at home, 
    May watch and pray together 
    Until Thy kingdom come. 
    In Thee for aye united, 
    Our song of hope we raise, 
    Till that blest shore is sighted. 
    Where all shall turn to praise!

    Nor fraud, nor deceit, nor the hand of oppression, 
    Can injure the dwellers in that holy grove;

    Who long the hallowed cross had born, 
    Still looking for the promised day; 
    While many a line of grief and care, 
    Upon his brow was furrowed there; 
    I asked what buoyed his spirits up, 
    "O this" said he--"the blessed hope." 

    2.
    And one I saw, with sword and shield, 
    Who boldly braved the world's cold frown, 
    And fought, unyielding, on the field, 
    To win an everlasting crown. 
    Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes, 
    No murmur from his heart arose; 
    I asked what buoyed his spirits up, 
    "O this!" said he--"the blessed hope." 

    3.
    And there was one who left behind 
    The cherished friends of early years, 
    And honor, pleasure, wealth resigned, 
    To tread the path bedewed with tears. 
    Through trials deep and conflict sore, 
    Yet still a smile of joy he wore; 
    I asked what buoyed his spirits up, 
    "O this!" said he--"the blessed hope." 

    4.
    While pilgrims here we journey on 
    In this dark vale of sin and gloom, 
    Through tribulation, hate, and scorn, 
    Or through the portals of the tomb, 
    Till our returning King shall come 
    To tkae His exile captives home, 
    O! what can bouy the spirits up? 
    'Tis this alone--the blessed hope.

    Life's sharp anguish must be borne; 
    Courage, then, ye faint and weary, 
    Linger not to weep and mourn.

    Pilgrims, on! the storm is beating, 
    Beating wildly on your way; 
    Tarry not, the time is fleeting; 
    Shall the storm your foot-steps stay? 
    Hasten on, through joy and sorrow, 
    Or whatever may betide, 
    Wait not for the calm tomorow, 
    Faithful at your work abide. 

    3.
    Pilgrims, on! what though in dangers, 
    Life's eventful course pursue; 
    Labor on, ye friendless strangers, 
    Grace will guide you safely through. 
    What if trials must befall you! 
    What if fierce temptations rise! 
    Shall earth's bitter strife appall you 
    While contending for the prize? 

    4.
    Pilgrims, on! there's rest in heaven, 
    Rest from every anxious care, 
    Rest in Jesus' smiles, forgiven, 
    Peaceful and eternal there. 
    O, 'twere sweet to toil in sadness, 
    O, 'twere well the cross to bear, 
    If, at last in joy or gladness, 
    We may rest forever there!

    There is a road, though narrow and obscure, 
    Which we must traverse till earth's days be past, 
    Which though unheeded by the passing throng, 
    Leads us to our eternal home at last. 

    2.
    Here trod the faithful when the work began; 
    Some still are with us, but, alas, not all; 
    Many have laid their heavy burdens down 
    And will rejoin us when the Lord shall call. 

    3.
    And there is One who, though to eye unseen, 
    Journeys besideus wheresoe'er we go; 
    Guards all our footsteps with the tenderest care, 
    And sorrows with us in our earthly woe. 

    4.
    Almost the city towers we can discern 
    And hear the music from those courts above. 
    Jesus is waiting with the table spread; 
    O what a welcome in those arms of love.

    O happy band of pilgrims,
    If onward ye will tread
    With Jesus as your fellow,
    To Jesus as your Head!

    2.
    O happy if ye labor
    As Jesus did for men;
    O happy if ye hunger
    As Jesus hungered then!

    3.
    The trials that beset you,
    The sorrows ye endure,
    The manifold temptations
    That death alone can cure,

    4.
    What are they but His jewels
    Of right celestial worth?
    What are they but the ladder
    Set up to heaven on earth?

    5.
    O happy band of pilgrims,
    Look upward to the skies,
    Where such a light affliction
    Shall win you such a prize!

    1.
    Whence came the armies of the sky, 
    John saw in vision bright? 
    Whence came their crowns, their robes, their palms, 
    Too pure for mortal sight? 

    2.
    Were these tried soldiers of the cross 
    Victorious in the fight? 
    Were these the trophies they had won, 
    Reserved in worlds of light? 

    3.
    Once they were mourners here below, 
    And poured out cries and tears; 
    They wrestled hard, as we do now, 
    With sins, and doubts, and fears. 

    4.
    They saw the star of Bethlehem 
    Arise in splendor bright; 
    They followed long its guiding ray, 
    Till beamed a clearer light. 

    5.
    From desert waste, and cities full, 
    From dungeons dark, they've come, 
    And now they claim their mansion fair, 
    They've found their long-sought home.

    More precious and more bright 
    Than all the joyless mockery 
    The world esteems delight. 

    2.
    There is a lovely star 
    That lights the darkest gloom, 
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er 
    The prospects of the tomb. 

    3.
    There is a cheering voice 
    That lifts the soul above, 
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt, 
    And whispers, "God is love," 

    4.
    That voice from Calvary's height 
    Proclaims the forgiven; 
    That star is revelation's light, 
    That hope, the hope of heaven.

    There is sweet rest for feet now weary, 
    In the rugged, upward way; 
    There is a morn when midnight dreary 
    Shall be lost in perfect day. 

    2.
    For that blest morn our hearts are longing, 
    When shall end earth's night of woe; 
    When, through those pearly portals thronging, 
    Mortal cares we'll leave below. 

    3.
    Soon to that city, bright, eternal, 
    Weary pilgrims all shall go; 
    Soon we shall rest in pastures vernal, 
    Where life's waters ceaseless flow. 

    4.
    Father above, in mercy guide us 
    To those mansions of the blest; 
    Safe in the Rock of Ages hide us 
    Till we gain our final rest.

    1.
    O who, in such a world as this, 
    Could bear his lot of pain, 
    Did not one radiant hope of bliss 
    Unclouded yet remain? 

    2.
    That hope the sovereign Lord has given 
    Who reigns above the skies; 
    Hope that unites the soul to heaven 
    By faith's endearing ties. 

    3.
    Each care, each ill of mortal birth, 
    Is sent in pitying love, 
    To lift the hungering heart from earth 
    And speed its flight above. 

    4.
    And every pang that wrings the breast, 
    And every joy that dies, 
    Bids us to seek a purer rest 
    And trust to holier ties.

    And everlasting love.

    1.
    Jesus, Savior, pilot me
    Over life's tempestuous sea;
    Unknown waves before me roll,
    Hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
    Chart and compass come from Thee;
    Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

    2.
    As a mother stills Her child,
    Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
    Boisterous waves obey Thy will,
    When Thou sayest to them, Be still!
    Wondrous sovreign of the sea,
    Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

    3.
    When at last I near the shore,
    And the fearful breakers roar
    'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
    Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
    May I hear Thee say to me,
    Fear not, I will pilot thee.

    He rests secure in God.

    He feeds in pastures large and fair, 
    Of love and truth divine; 
    O child of God, 0 glory's heir! 
    How rich a lot is thine!

    A hand almighty to defend, 
    An ear for every call, 
    An honored life, a peaceful end, 
    And heaven to crown it all.

    O, tell me, Thou life and delight of my soul, 
    Where the flock of Thy pasture are feeding. 
    I seek Thy protection, I need Thy control; 
    I would go where my Shepherd is leading. 

    2.
    O, tell me the place where the flock are at rest, 
    Where the noontide will find them reposing; 
    The tempest now rages, my soul is distressed, 
    And the pathway of peace I am losing. 

    3.
    And why should I stray with the flocks of Thy foes, 
    In the desert where now they are roving; 
    Where hunger and thirst, where contentions and woes, 
    Where fierce conflicts their ruin are proving? 

    4.
    Ah, when shall my woes and my wandering cease, 
    And the follies that fill me with weeping? 
    O Shepherd of Israel, restore me that peace 
    Thou dost give to the flock Thou art keeping! 

    5.
    A voice from the Shepherd now bids me return 
    By the way where the footprints are lying; 
    No longer to wander, no longer to mourn; 
    And homeward my spirit is flying.

    Shouldst lead me on;

    Pride ruled my will, Remember not past years.

    So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still 
    Will lead me on

    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

    And wraps the soul in calm and sweet repose;

    The sunset, and the morning 
    That brighten up the sky. 

    3.
    The cold wind in the winter, 
    The pleasant summer sun, 
    The ripe fruits in the garden, 
    He made them, every one. 

    4.
    He gave us eyes to see them, 
    And lips that we might tell 
    How great is God Almighty, 
    Who has made all things well.
 
 

## 422.  I Think When I Read That Sweet Story
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_foxiqPGlrPWNCogcHNoqkJOrP4lchI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I think when I read that sweet story of old,
    When Jesus was here among men,
    How He called little children as lambs to His fold,
    I should like to have been with Him then.

    2.
    I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
    That His arm had been thrown around me,
    And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,
    "Let the little ones come unto Me."

    3.
    I long for the joy of that glorious time,
    The sweetest and brightest and best,
    When the dear little children of every clime
    Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.
 
 

## 423.  I Am So Glad That Our Father
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YskM_vpnyCaeYLn4rt1z6OSmASd0W9kF/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I am so glad that our Father in heaven 
    Tells of His love in the Book He has given, 
    Wonderful things in the Bible I see; 
    This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me. 
    Refrain:
    I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
    Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, 
    I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
    Jesus loves even me. 

    2.
    Though I forget Him and wander away, 
    Still He doth love me wherever I stray; 
    Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, 
    When I remember that Jesus loves me. 

    3.
    O, if there's only one song I can sing, 
    When in His beauty I see the great King, 
    This shall my song in eternity be: " 
    O, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."
 
 

## 424.  'Once in Royal David''s City'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn2XPTGQwuczyJh5u_pXXxi6H6zPACdh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Once in royal David's city
    Stood a lowly cattle shed,
    Where a mother laid her Baby
    In a manger for His bed;
    Mary was that mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little Child.

    2.
    He came down to earth from heaven,
    Who is God and Lord of all,
    And His shelter was a stable,
    And His cradle was a stall;
    With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
    Lived on earth our Savior holy.

    3.
    And through all His wondrous childhood
    He would honor and obey,
    Love and watch the lowly mother
    In whose gentle arms He lay.
    Christian children all must be
    Mild, obedient, good as He.

    4.
    And our eyes at last shall see Him,
    Through His own redeeming love;
    For that Child so dear and gentle
    Is our Lord in heaven above;
    And He leads His children on
    To the place where He is gone.
 
 

## 425.  I Would Be True
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZA58wdYa5oyjBrpjGUVLTq3JXbCAyVRi/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I would be true, for there are those who trust me; 
    I would be pure, for there are those who care; 
    I would be strong, for there is much to suffer; 
    I would be brave, for there is much to dare; 
    I would be brave, for there is much to dare. 

    2.
    I would be friend of all'the foe, the friendless; 
    I would be giving, and forget the gift; 
    I would be humble, for I know my weakness; 
    I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift; 
    I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift. 

    3.
    I would be learning, day by day, the lessons 
    My heavenly Father gives me in His word; 
    I would be quick to hear His lightest whisper, 
    And prompt and glad to do the things I've heard; 
    And prompt and glad to do the things I've heard.

    1.
    O holy Lord, content to fill 
    In lowly home the lowliest place; 
    Thy childhood's law, a mother's will; 
    Obedience meek, Thy brightest grace. 

    2.
    Lead every child that bears Thy name 
    To walk in Thine own guileless way, 
    To dread the touch of sin and shame, 
    And humbly, like Thyself, obey. 

    3.
    So shall we, waiting here below, 
    Like Thee, our Lord, a little span, 
    In wisdom and in stature grow, 
    And favor with both God and man.

    1.
    Saviour, while my heart is tender, 
    I would yield that heart to Thee; 
    All my powers to Thee surrender, 
    Thine, and only Thine, to be. 

    2.
    Take me now, Lord Jesus, take me, 
    Let my youthful heart be Thine; 
    Thy devoted servant make me, 
    Fill my soul with love divine. 

    3.
    Send me, Lord, where Thou wilt send me, 
    Only do Thou guide my way; 
    May Thy grace through life attend me; 
    Gladly then shall I obey.
 
 

## 428.  Hushed Was the Evening Hymn
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z61UsSxQqsucvIwkm8N7uHawjGaTCoIX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hushed was the evening hymn, 
    The temple courts were dark, 
    The lamp was burning dim 
    Before the sacred ark, 
    When suddenly a voice divine 
    Rang through the silence of the shrine. 

    2.
    O give me Samuel's ear. 
    The open ear, O Lord, 
    Alive and quick to hear 
    Each whisper of Thy word! 
    Like him to answer at Thy call 
    And to obey Thee first of all. 

    3.
    O give me Samuel's heart, 
    A lowly heart, that waits 
    Where in Thy house Thou art, 
    Or watches at Thy gates! 
    By day and night, a heart that still 
    Moves at the breathing of Thy will. 

    4.
    O give me Samuel's mind, 
    A sweet, unmurmuring faith, 
    Obedient and resigned 
    To Thee in life and death! 
    That I may read with childlike eyes 
    Truths that are hidden from the wise.

    1.
    Jesus, I will follow Thee, 
    For I hear Thee calling me; 
    Loving, trusting, glad I come, 
    To let Thee lead me home. 
    Refrain:
    I will follow Thee, 
    I will follow Thee, 
    I will follow Thee, 
    Wherever Thou dost lead. 

    2.
    Little eyes might lose the way, 
    Little feet might go astray; 
    I might weak and weary be, 
    But Thou art strong for me. 

    3.
    Grief and want may be my foes, 
    Foolish sins my way oppose; 
    Full of courage I will be, 
    Whene'er I follow Thee.

    1.
    Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
    Bless Thy little lamb tonight;
    Through the darkness be Thou near me;
    Watch my sleep till morning light.

    2.
    All this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care;
    Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
    Listen to my evening prayer.

    1.
    How sweet, how heavenly is the sight 
    When those who love the Lord 
    In one another's peace delight, 
    And thus fulfill His word. 

    2.
    When each can feel his brother's sigh, 
    And with him bear a part; 
    When sorrow flows from eye to eye, 
    And joy from heart to heart. 

    3.
    When free from envy, scorn, and pride, 
    Our wishes all above, 
    Each can his brother's failings hide, 
    And show a brother's love. 

    4.
    When love, in one delightful stream, 
    Through every bosom flows; 
    And union sweet, and dear esteem, 
    In every action glows. 

    5.
    Love is the golden chain that binds 
    The happy souls above, 
    And he's an heir of heaven who finds 
    His bosom glow with love.

    Major Key: F

    1.
    Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love;
    The fellowship of kindred minds
    Is like to that above.

    2.
    Before our Father's throne
    We pour our ardent prayers;
    Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
    Our comforts and our cares.

    3.
    We share each other's woes,
    Our mutual burdens bear;
    And often for each other flows
    The sympathizing tear.

    4.
    When we asunder part,
    It gives us inward pain;
    But we shall still be joined in heart,
    And hope to meet again.
 
 

## 433.  The Church Has One Foundation
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NNlGXtpVL7aJGNR6ivqd9JjxhIl2Lru/edit?mode=html)



    Major Key: D

    1.
    The church has one foundation
    Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
    She is His new creation
    By water and the Word.
    From heaven He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride;
    With His own blood He bought her,
    And for her life He died. 

    2.
    Elect from every nation,
    Yet one o'er all the earth;
    Her charter of salvation,
    One Lord, one faith, one birth;
    One holy name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With every grace endued.

    3.
    Though with a scornful wonder
    We see her sore oppressed,
    By schisms rent asunder,
    By heresies distressed,
    Yet saints their watch are keeping;
    Their cry goes up, How long?
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.

    4.
    'Mid toil and tribulation,
    And tumult of her war,
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace forevermore;
    Till, with the vision glorious,
    Her longing eyes are blest,
    And the great church victorious
    Shall be the church at rest.

    1.
    O golden day, so long desired, 
    Born of a darksome night, 
    The waiting earth at last is fired 
    By thy resplendent light. 
    And hark! the promised heavenly chord 
    Is heard from sea to sea, 
    This song: One Master, Christ the Lord, 
    And brethren all are we. 

    2.
    The noises of the night shall cease, 
    The storms no longer roar; 
    The factious foes of love and peace 
    Shall vex the soul no more. 
    A thousand thousand voices sing 
    The surging harmony; 
    One Master, Christ, one Saviour King, 
    And brethren all are we. 

    3.
    Sing on, ye heralds of the morn, 
    Your grand endeavor strain, 
    Till Christian hearts estranged and torn, 
    Blend in the glad refrain; 
    And all the church, with all its powers, 
    In loving loyalty, 
    Shall sing: One Master, Christ, is ours, 
    And brethren all are we. 

    4.
    O golden day! the ages crown, 
    Aglow with heavenly love, 
    Rare day in prophecy's renown, 
    On to thy zenith move, 
    When earth and heaven with one accord, 
    In full-voiced unity, 
    Shall sing: One Master, Christ our Lord, 
    And brethren all are we.

    1.
    O where are kings and empires now 
    Of old that went and came? 
    But, Lord, Thy church is praying yet, 
    A thousand years the same. 

    2.
    We mark her goodly battlements, 
    And her foundations strong; 
    We hear within the solemn voice 
    Of her unending song. 

    3.
    For not like kingdoms of the world 
    Thy holy church, 0 God; 
    Though earthquake shocks are threatening her, 
    And tempests are abroad; 

    4.
    Unshaken as eternal hills, 
    Immovable she stands, 
    A mountain that shall fill the earth, 
    A house not made by hands.

    1.
    In Christ there is no east nor west,
    In Him no south or north;
    But one great fellowship of love
    Throughout the whole wide earth.

    2.
    In Him shall true heart everywhere
    Their high communion find;
    His service is the golden cord
    Close binding all mankind.

    3.
    Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
    Whate'er your race may be.
    Who serves my Father as a son
    Is surely kin to me.

    4.
    In Christ now meet both east and west,
    In Him meet south and north;
    All Christly souls are one in Him
    Throughout the whole wide earth.

    1.
    Lord, her watch Thy church is keeping; 
    When shall earth Thy rule obey? 
    When shall end the night of weeping? 
    When shall break the promised day? 
    See the whitening harvest languish, 
    Waiting still the laborers' toil; 
    Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish? 
    Shall the strong retain the spoil? 

    2.
    Tidings, sent for every creature, 
    Millions yet have never heard; 
    Can they hear without a preacher? 
    Lord Almighty, give the word; 
    Give the word; in every nation 
    Let the gospel trumpet sound, 
    Witnessing of Thy salvation 
    To the earth's remotest bound. 

    3.
    Then the end, Thy church completed, 
    All Thy chosen gathered in, 
    With their King in glory seated, 
    Satan bound, and banished sin; 
    Gone foreyer, parting, weeping, 
    Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain; 
    Lo! her watch Thy church is keeping; 
    Come, Lord Jesus; come to reign.

    Buried beneath the yielding wave 
    The great Redeemer lies; 
    Faith views Him in the watery grave, 
    And hence beholds Him rise. 

    2.
    Thus do these willing souls today 
    Their ardent zeal express, 
    And in the Lord's appointed way 
    Fulfill all righteousness. 

    3.
    With joy we in His footsteps tread, 
    And would His cause maintain; 
    Like Him be numbered with the dead, 
    And with Him rise and reign.

    His presence oft revives our hearts,

    2.
    On Thee, on Thee alone, 
    Our hope and faith rely, 
    O Thou who wilt for sin atone, 
    Who didst for sinners die!

    I'll make your great commission known,
    And ye shall prove My gospel true
    By all the works that I have done,
    By all the wonders ye shall do.

    All power is vested in My hands;
    I can destroy, and I defend.

    1.
    Go, labor on, while yet 'tis day; 
    The world's dark night is hastening on; 
    Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away! 
    It is not thus that souls are won. 

    2.
    Men die in darkness at your side 
    Without a hope to cheer the tomb; 
    Take up the torch and wave it wide' 
    The torch that lights time's thickest gloom. 

    3.
    Toil on, faint not, keep watch, and pray! 
    Be wise the erring soul to win, 
    Go forth into the world's highway, 
    Compel the wanderer to come in. 

    4.
    Go, labor on; your hands are weak, 
    Your knees are faint, your soul cast down; 
    Yet falter not; the prize you seek 
    Is near'a kingdom and a crown!

    How charming is their voice,
    So sweet the tidings are:
    Zion, behold thy Savior King;
    He reigns and triumphs here!

    3.
    How happy are our ears,
    That hear the joyful sound
    Which kings and prophets waited for,
    And sought, but never found!

    4.
    How blessed are our eyes,
    That see this heavenly light;
    Prophets and kings desired it long,
    But died without the sight!

    5.
    The watchmen join their voice,
    And tuneful notes employ;
    Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UKYUrTpToeQYbY3EYt4hQzqBcwDuLc2J/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Workman of God, O lose not heart, 
    But learn what God is like; 
    And on the darkest battlefield 
    Thou shalt know where to strike. 

    2.
    Thrice blest is he to whom is given 
    The instinct that can tell 
    That God is on the field, when He 
    Is most invisible. 

    3.
    Blest, too, is he who can divine 
    Where truth and justice lie, 
    And dares to take the side that seems 
    Wrong to man's blinded eye. 

    4.
    Then learn to scorn the praise of men, 
    And learn to lose with God; 
    For Jesus won the world through shame, 
    And beckons thee His road. 

    5.
    For right is right, since God is God, 
    And right the day must win; 
    To doubt would be disloyalty, 
    To falter would be sin.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ukvrk3gc6E_Oa%2DpD_auK29AdOM4rsBpz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Ho! reapers of life's harvest, 
    Why stand with rusty blade 
    Until the night draws round thee, 
    And day begins to fade? 
    Why stand ye idle, waiting 
    For reapers more to come? 
    The golden morn is passing; 
    Why sit ye idle, dumb? 

    2.
    Thrust in your sharpened sickle, 
    And gather in the grain; 
    The night is fast approaching, 
    And soon will come again. 
    The Master calls for reapers, 
    And shall He call in vain? 
    Shall sheaves lie there ungathered, 
    And waste upon the plain? 

    3.
    Come down from hill and mountain, 
    In morning's ruddy glow, 
    Nor wait until the dial 
    Points to the noon below; 
    And come with the strong sinew, 
    Nor faint in heat or cold; 
    And pause not till the evening 
    Draws round its wealth of gold. 

    4.
    Mount up the heights of wisdom, 
    And crush each error low; 
    Keep back no words of knowledge 
    That human hearts should know. 
    Be faithful to thy mission, 
    In service of thy Lord, 
    And soon a golden chaplet 
    Will be thy rich reward.

    From many a palmy plain, 
    They call us to deliver

    2.
    What though the spicy breezes 
    Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle; 
    Though every prospect pleases, 
    And only man is vile; 
    In vain with lavish kindness 
    The gifts of God are strewn; 
    The heathen in his blindness, 
    Bows down to wood and stone. 

    3.
    Can men, whose souls are lighted 
    With wisdom from on high, 
    Can they to men benighted 
    The lamp of life deny? 
    Salvation! O salvation! 
    The joyful sound proclaim, 
    Till earth's remotest nation 
    Has learned Messiah's name. 

    4.
    Waft, waft, ye winds, His story, 
    And you, ye waters, roll, 
    Till, like a sea of glory, 
    It spreads from pole to pole; 
    Till o'er our ransomed nature 
    The Lamb for sinners slain, 
    Redeemer, King, Creator, 
    In bliss returns to reign.

    Work for the night is coming, 
    Work through the morning hours; 
    Work while the dew is sparkling; 
    Work 'mid springing flowers; 
    Work while the day grows brighter, 
    Work in the glowing sun; 
    Work for the night is coming, 
    When man's work is done. 

    2.
    Work for the night is coming, 
    Work through the sunny noon; 
    Fill brightest hours with labor, 
    Rest comes sure and soon. 
    Give every flying minute 
    Something to keep in store; 
    Work for the night is coming, 
    When man works no more. 

    3.
    Work for the night is coming, 
    Under the sunset skies; 
    While their bright tints are glowing, 
    Work for daylight flies. 
    Work till the last beam fadeth, 
    Fadeth to shine no more; 
    Work while the night is darkening, 
    When man's work is o'er.

    1.
    Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,
    Who will go and work today?
    Fields are white, the harvest waiting,
    Who will bear the sheaves away?
    Loud and long the Master calleth,
    Rich reward He offers free;
    Who will answer, gladly saying,
    Here am I, O Lord, send me?

    2.
    If you cannot cross the ocean
    And the heathen lands explore,
    You can find the heathen nearer,
    You can help them at your door;
    If you cannot speak like angels,
    If you cannot preach like Paul,
    You can tell the love of Jesus,
    You can say He died for all.

    3.
    If you cannot be the watchman,
    Standing high on Zion's wall,
    Pointing out the path to heaven,
    Offering life and peace to all;
    With your prayers and with your bounties
    You can do what Heaven demands,
    You can be like faithful Aaron,
    Holding up the prophet's hands.

    4.
    While the souls of men are dying,
    And the Master calls for you,
    Let none hear you idly saying,
    There is nothing I can do!
    Gladly take the task He gives you,
    Let His work your pleasure be;
    Answer quickly when He calleth,
    Here am I, O Lord, send me.

    That God, in whom they live and move, is love; 
    Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation, 
    And died on earth that we might live above. 

    3.
    Give of thine own to bear the message glorious; 
    Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way; 
    Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious; 
    O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day. 

    4.
    He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,
    Make known to every heart His saving grace;

    Skyward and seaward, high and wide; 
    Our glory only in the cross; 
    Our only hope, the Crucified. 

    2.
    Fling out the banner! angels bend 
    In anxious silence o'er the sign, 
    And vainly seek to comprehend 
    The wonder of the love divine. 

    3.
    Fling out the banner! sin-sick souls, 
    That sink and perish in the strife, 
    Shall touch in faith its radiant hem, 
    And spring immortal into life. 

    4.
    Fling out the banner! wide and high,

    And dwell in their Father's house; 
    To gaze at His lovely face, 
    And clothed with His purity, 
    Join with Him in song and joy 
    Throughout eternity.

    They come from the thorny path, 
    They come from the stormy sea, 
    They come from the hills, 
    They come from the dales, 
    They come now, 0 Lord, to Thee, 
    Arrayed in His marriage robes, 
    Their Bridegroom so soon to see, 
    He who hung upon the cross 
    To win their victory.

    Here gathers a countless host 
    Redeemed by His grace from wrong. 
    No more any sin, no more any tears,

    All things are become as new. 
    Joy shall reign eternally, 
    For death is ended, too. 

    4.
    Remember the pearly gate 
    Stands open for you and me. 
    Our Saviour has gone a place to prepare 
    For those He from sin set free. 
    Loved ones who have passed away 
    Are resting within the grave, 
    Awaiting God's last trumpet call, 
    For those He came to save.

    While sinners, now confessing, 
    The gospel call obey, 
    And seek the Saviour's blessing, 
    A nation in a day. 

    3.
    Blest river of salvation, 
    Pursue thy onward way; 
    Flow thou to every nation, 
    Nor in thy richness stay 
    Stay not till all the lowly, 
    Triumphant reach their home; 
    Stay not till all the holy 
    Proclaim, "The Lord is come!"

    To some exhausted land,
    As shade of clustered palm trees
    'Mid weary wastes of sand.

    2.
    Lord, we would bring for offering,
    Though marred with earthly soil,
    A week of earnest labor,
    Of steady, faithful toil,
    Fair fruits of self denial,
    Of strong, deep love to Thee,
    Fostered by Thine own Spirit,
    In true humility.

    3.
    And we would bring our burden
    Of sinful thought and deed,
    In Thy pure presence kneeling,
    From bondage to be freed,
    Our heart's most bitter sorrow
    For all Thy work undone-
    So many talents wasted!
    So few bright laurels won!

    4.
    And with that sorrow mingling,
    A steadfast faith, and sure,
    And love so deep and fervent,
    For Thee to make it pure,
    In Thy dear presence finding
    The pardon that we need,
    And then the peace so lasting-
    Celestial peace indeed.

## 473.  Once in Jerusalem
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGfiNtNRMlOyBOITamNqFoJKjxntk3NE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Once in Jerusalem of old 
    Our Saviour washed their feet 
    Who climbed with Him Judea's hills, 
    And roved its valleys sweet. 
    With lowly attitude and mien 
    To them He bowed the knee, 
    Thus showing how love's service blends 
    With meek humility. 

    2.
    But far from that low path of grace 
    His people since have trod, 
    And erring feet have trampled down 
    The ordinance of God. 
    Come brothers, sisters, let us raise 
    This long-forgotten rite; 
    Bow each to each with humble minds, 
    And walk in duty's light. 

    3.
    With holy kiss, with words of love, 
    With hearts all kind and true, 
    We'll banish thoughts of envious pride, 
    As Jesus' friends should do. 
    Dear Saviour, help us keep more near 
    The good old Bible ways; 
    Head, hands, and feet we pray Thee wash, 
    That we may speak Thy praise.

    Be of sin the double cure,
    Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

    2.
    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

    3.
    When my pilgrimage I close;
    Victor o'er the last of foes,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    And behold Thee on Thy throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee.

    Lay we, like Magdalene, 
    Here at Thy feet; 
    Yet may love's incense rise, 
    Sweeter than sacrifice, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee. 

    2.
    Daily our lives would show 
    Weakness made strong, 
    Toilsome and gloomy ways 
    Brightened with song; 
    Some deeds of kindness done, 
    Some souls by patience won, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee. 

    3.
    Some word of hope, for hearts 
    Burdened with fears, 
    Some balm of peace, for eyes 
    Blinded with tears, 
    Some dews of mercy shed, 
    Some wayward footsteps led, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee. 

    4.
    Thus, in Thy service, Lord, 
    'Till even tide 
    Closes the day of life, 
    May we abide, 
    Anti when earth's labors cease, 
    Bid us depart in peace, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee.

    When we who have His name confessed,

    Confess our names before the throne,

    If Cod be ours, we're traveling home, 
    Though passing through a vale of tears.
 
 

## 491.  See the Leaves Around Us Falling
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y51ws6K2dgErlHO41dojuEOhCNoHBPBm/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    See the leaves around us falling, 
    Dry and withered to the ground; 
    Thus to thoughtless mortals calling, 
    In a sad and solemn sound: 

    2.
    "Youth on length of days presuming, 
    Who the paths of pleasure tread, 
    View us, late in beauty blooming, 
    Numbered now among the dead. 

    3.
    "Yearly in our course appearing, 
    Messengers of shortest stay, 
    Thus we preach in mortal hearing' 
    Ye, like us, shall pass away."
 
 

## 492.  Dark Is the Hour
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YW%2DlHWWVeKMLEfE5oaCB37hHS_7URG7_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Dark is the hour when death prevails, 
    And triumphs o'er the just' 
    A painful void within the breast, 
    When dust goes back to dust; 
    And solemn is the pall, the bier, 
    That bears them from our presence here. 

    2.
    But there's a bright, a glorious hope, 
    That scatters death's dark gloom; 
    It cheers the saddened spirits up, 
    It gilds the Christian's tomb; 
    It brings the resurrection near, 
    When those we love shall reappear. 

    3.
    Then mourn we not as those whose hopes 
    With fleeting life depart; 
    For we have heard a voice from heaven 
    To every stricken heart: 
    "Blest are the dead, forever blest, 
    Who from henceforth in Jesus rest." 

    4.
    With kind regard the Lord beholds 
    His saints when called to die, 
    And precious in His holy sight 
    Their sacred dust shall lie 
    Till all these storms of life are o'er, 
    And they shall rise to die no more. 

    5.
    A few more days, and we shall meet 
    The loved whose toil is o'er, 
    And plant with joy our bounding feet 
    On Canaan's radiant shore, 
    Where, free from all earth's cares and fears, 
    We'll part no more through endless years.
 
 

## 493.  Sweet Be Thy Rest
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNme3ZNSgLYGrQIO%2DPSn2BEaq6O67HJK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweet be thy rest, 
    And peaceful thy sleeping; 
    God's way is best, 
    Thou art in His keeping. 
    O blessed sleep 
    Where ills ne'er molest thee! 
    Why should we weep? 
    For Heaven hath blessed thee, 
    Sweet be thy rest. 

    2.
    Thy work is done, 
    Thy sowing and reaping; 
    Thy crown is won, 
    And hushed is thy weeping. 
    From tears and woes, 
    From earth's midnight dreary, 
    Thine is repose 
    Where none ever weary. 
    Sweet be thy rest. 

    3.
    Sweet be thy rest; 
    No more we may greet thee 
    'Till with the blest 
    In heaven we meet thee. 
    O union sweet 
    That death cannot sever! 
    There we shall meet, 
    Where sad tears fall never. 
    Sweet be thy rest.

    1.
    He sleeps in Jesus'peaceful rest' 
    No mortal strife invades his breast; 
    No pain, nor sin, nor woe, nor care, 
    Can reach the silent slumberer there. 

    2.
    He lived his Saviour to adore, 
    And meekly all his sufferings bore: 
    He loved, and all resigned to God, 
    Nor murmured at His chastening rod. 

    3.
    "Does earth attract thee here?" they cried; 
    The dying Christian thus replied, 
    While pointing upward to the sky, 
    "My treasure is laid up on high." 

    4.
    He sleeps in Jesus'soon to rise, 
    When the last trump shall rend the skies; 
    Then burst the fetters of the tomb, 
    To wake in full, immortal bloom. 

    5.
    He sleeps in Jesus'cease thy grief; 
    Let this afford thee sweet relief, 
    That, freed from death's triumphant reign, 
    In heaven he will live again.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YB0uqvzOqPN7OuuidM8U%2Dkd40LFkRx4g/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Not now, but in the coming years, 
    It may be in the better land, 
    We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
    And there, sometime, we'll understand. 
    Refrain:
    Then trust in God through all thy days; 
    Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
    Though dark thy way, still sing and praise, 
    Sometime, sometime, we'll understand. 

    2.
    We'll catch the broken thread again, 
    And finish what we here began; 
    Heaven will the mysteries explain, 
    And then, ah, then we'll understand. 

    3.
    We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
    Were over many a cherished plan; 
    Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
    'Tis there, sometime, we'll understand. 

    4.
    Why what we long for most of all, 
    Eludes so oft our eager hand; 
    Why hopes are crushed and castles fall, 
    Up there, sometime, we'll understand. 

    5.
    God knows the way, He holds the key, 
    He guides us with unerring hand; 
    Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see; 
    Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.

    1.
    Come, ye thankful people, come,
    Raise the song of harvest home;
    All is safely gathered in,
    Ere the winter storms begin.
    God our Maker doth provide
    For our wants to be supplied;
    Come to God's own temple, come;
    Raise the song of harvest home!

    2.
    We ourselves are God's own field,
    Fruit unto His praise to yield;
    Wheat and tares together sown,
    Unto joy or sorrow grown;
    First the blade and then the ear,
    Then the full corn shall appear;
    Grant, O harvest Lord, that we
    Wholesome grain and pure may be.

    3.
    For the Lord our God shall come,
    And shall take His harvest home;
    From His field shall purge away
    All that doth offend, that day;
    Give His angels charge at last
    In the fire the tares to cast;
    But the fruitful ears to store
    In His garner evermore.

    4.
    Then, thou church triumphant, come,
    Raise the song of harvest home;
    All are safely gathered in,
    Free from sorrow, free from sin,
    There, forever purified,
    In God's garner to abide;
    Come, ten thousand angels, come,
    Raise the glorious harvest home!

    1.
     Standing by a purpose true, 
    Heeding God's command, 
    Honor them, the faithful few, 
    All hail to Daniel's band! 
    Refrain:
    Dare to be a Daniel, 
    Dare to stand alone! 
    Dare to have a purpose firm! 
    Dare to make it known! 

    2.
    Many mighty men are lost, 
    Daring not to stand, 
    Who for God had been a host 
    By joining Daniel's band! 

    3.
    Many giants great and tall, 
    Stalking through the land, 
    Headlong to the earth would fall 
    If met by Daniel's band! 

    4.
    Hold the temperance banner high! 
    On to victory grand! 
    Satan and his host defy, 
    And shout for Daniel's band!

    1.
    Yield not to temptation, 
    For yielding is sin, 
    Each victory will help you 
    Some other to win; 
    Fight manfully onward, 
    Dark passions subdue, 
    Look ever to Jesus, 
    He'll carry you through. 
    Refrain:
    Ask the Saviour to help you, 
    Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
    He is willing to aid you, 
    He will carry you through. 

    2.
    Shun evil companions, 
    Bad language disdain, 
    God's name hold in reverence, 
    Nor take it in vain; 
    Be thoughtful and earnest, 
    Kindhearted and true, 
    Look ever to Jesus, 
    He'll carry you through. 

    3.
    To him that o'ercometh 
    God giveth a crown, 
    Through faith we shall conquer, 
    Though often cast down; 
    He who is our Saviour 
    Our strength will renew, 
    Look ever to Jesus, 
    He'll carry you through.

    Sound the battle cry,
    See! the foe is nigh;
    Raise the standard high
    For the Lord;
    Gird your armor on,
    Stand firm, every one,
    Rest your cause upon His holy word.
    CHORUS:
    Rouse, then soldiers!
    Rally round the banner!
    Ready, steady, pass the word along;
    Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
    Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

    2.
    Strong to meet the foe,
    Marching on we go,
    While our cause we know
    Must prevail;
    Shield and banner bright,
    Gleaming in the light,
    Battling for the right,
    We ne'er can fail.

    3.
    O Thou God of all,
    Hear us when we call,
    Help us, one and all,
    By Thy grace;
    When the battle�s done,
    And the victory won,
    May we wear the crown
    Before Thy face.

    Sons of freedom, come ye all. 
    Refrain:
    Raise the temperance standard high, 
    Shout the mighty battle cry; 
    Let the evil kingdom fall, 
    Sons of freedom, come ye all. 

    2.
    Over sea and land 
    With an iron hand, 
    Has the monarch held his sway; 
    But his rule shall cease, 
    And the reign of peace 
    Usher in the golden day. 

    3.
    Let the right prevail, 
    Let the evil fail 
    In the conflict fierce and long, 
    'Till the land is free, 
    And the victory 
    Crowns the temperance army strong.

    1.
    Out from the campfire's red glowing, 
    Cheerfully shedding its light, 
    On to the pickets we're going, 
    For the long watches of night; 
    Let us be careful that slumber 
    Press not our eyelids too hard' 
    Surely not one of our number 
    Must be found sleeping on guard. 
    Refrain:
    Yes, sleeping on guard, 
    Sleeping on guard, 
    No! surely not one of our number 
    Must be found sleeping on guard. 

    2.
    Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning; 
    Hark to the revelry there! 
    Waiting the conflict returning, 
    Scouts are abroad everywhere; 
    We must be watchful and ready, 
    See every entrance is barred, 
    Keeping our heads cool and steady' 
    All is lost, sleeping on guard. 

    3.
    Our aim is vigilance ever, 
    We can allow no defeat; 
    Truehearted soldiers will never 
    Join in the coward's retreat; 
    Wary and watchful be keeping, 
    Though the task be e'er so hard, 
    Knowing what dangers come creeping 
    When we are sleeping on guard.

    Mourn for the lost'but call,

    3.
    Mourn for the lost'but pray, 
    Pray to our God above, 
    To break the fell destroyer's sway, 
    And show His saving love.

    God of our fathers, known of old, 
    Lord of our far-flung battle line, 
    Beneath whose awful hand we hold 
    Dominion over palm and pine, 
    Lord God of hosts, be with us yet, 
    Lest we forget, lest we forget. 

    2.
    The tumult and the shouting dies; 
    The captains and the kings depart; 
    Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice, 
    A humble and a contrite heart. 
    Lord God of hosts, be with us yet, 
    Lest we forget, lest we forget. 

    3.
    Far called, our navies melt away; 
    On dune and headland sinks the fire; 
    Lo, all our pomp of yesterday 
    Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! 
    Judge of the nations, spare us yet, 
    Lest we forget, lest we forget.

    If, drunk with sight of power, we loose 
    Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, 
    Such boastings as the Gentiles use, 
    Or lesser breeds without the law' 
    Lord God of hosts, be with us yet, 
    Lest we forget, lest we forget. 

    5.
    For heathen heart that puts her trust 
    In reeking tube and iron shard; 
    All valiant dust that builds on dust, 
    And, guarding, calls not Thee to guard, 
    For frantic boast and foolish word, 
    Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord.

    O God, beneath Thy guiding hand

    Thou heardest, well pleased, the song, the prayer; 
    Thy blessing came; and still its power 
    Shall onward, through all ages, bear 
    The memory of that holy hour.

    Came with those exiles o'er the waves; 
    And, where their pilgrim feet have trod, 
    The God they trusted guards their graves. 

    4.
    And here Thy Name, 0 God of love, 
    Their children's children shall adore, 
    Till these eternal hills remove, 
    And spring adorns the earth no more.

## 512.  'God Bless Our Native Land!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSB%2Dq5_HK_LegXPjzYHOudTBBHSRyt%2Do/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God bless our native land! 
    May Heaven's protecting hand 
    Still guard our shore. 
    May peace her power extend, 
    Foe be transformed to friend, 
    And all our rights depend 
    On war no more. 

    2.
    May just and righteous laws 
    Uphold the public cause, 
    And bless our name; 
    Home of the brave and free, 
    Stronghold of liberty, 
    We pray that still on thee 
    May rest no stain. 

    3.
    And not this land alone, 
    But be Thy mercies known 
    From shore to shore; 
    O that all men would see 
    That they should brothers he, 
    And form one family, 
    The wide world o'er!
 
 

## 513.  Once to Every Man and Nation
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSI95HPhouzuf_DDEeJoJeokMzFWDlIt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Once to every man and nation, Comes the moment to decide,
    In the strife of truth with falsehood, For the good or evil side;
    Some great cause, some great decision, Offering each the bloom or blight,
    And the choice goes by forever, 'Twixt that darkness and that light.

    2.
    Then to side with truth is noble, When we share her wretched crust,
    Ere her cause bring fame and profit, And 'tis prosperous to be just;
    Then it is the brave man chooses While the coward stands aside,
    Till the multitude make virtue Of the faith they had denied.

    3.
    By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
    Toiling up new Calv'ries ever With the cross that turns not back;
    New occasions teach new duties, Time makes ancient good uncouth,
    They must upward still and onward, Who would keep abreast of truth.

    4.
    Though the cause of evil prosper, Yet the truth alone is strong;
    Though her portion be the scaffold, And upon the throne be wrong;
    Yet that scaffold sways the future, And behind the dim unknown,
    Standeth God within the shadow, Keeping watch above His own.

    1.
    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, 
    The flying cloud, the frosty light; 
    The year will die ere falls the night; 
    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. 
    Ring out the old, ring in the new, 
    Ring, happy bells, across the snow; 
    The year is going, let him go; 
    Ring out the false, ring in the true. 

    2.
    Ring out the grief that saps the mind, 
    For those that here we see no more; 
    Ring out the feud of rich and poor, 
    Ring in redress to all mankind. 
    Ring out false pride in place and blood, 
    The civic slander and the spite; 
    Ring in the love of truth and right, 
    Ring in the common love of good. 

    3.
    Ring out old shapes of foul disease, 
    Ring out the narrowing lust of gold; 
    Ring out the thousand wars of old, 
    Ring in the thousand years of peace. 
    Ring in the valiant man and free, 
    The larger heart, the kindlier hand; 
    Ring out the darkness of the land, 
    Ring in the Christ that is to be.

    1.
    Sweet the time, exceeding sweet! 
    When the saints together meet, 
    When the Saviour is the theme, 
    When they join to sing of Him. 

    2.
    Sing we then eternal love, 
    Such as did the Father move; 
    He beheld the world undone, 
    Loved the world and gave His Son. 

    3.
    Sing the Son's amazing love; 
    How He left the realms above, 
    Took our nature and our place, 
    Lived and died to save our race. 

    4.
    Sing we, too, the Spirit's love; 
    With our stubborn hearts He strove, 
    Filled our minds with grief and fear, 
    Brought the precious Saviour near. 

    5.
    Sweet the time, exceeding sweet, 
    When the saints in heaven shall meet; 
    Jesus still will be the theme, 
    They shall always sing of Him.

    2.
    There's no other name like Jesus
    When the heart with grief is sad,
    There's no other name like Jesus
    When the heart is free and glad.

    3.
    'Tis the hope that I shall see Him
    When in glory He appears,
    'Tis the hope to hear His welcome
    That my fainting spirit cheers.

    4.
    If He wills that I should labor
    In His vineyard day by day,
    Then 'tis well if only Jesus
    Blesses all I do or say.

    5.
    If He wills that death's cold finger
    Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
    Then 'tis well if only Jesus
    Is my dying trust and stay.

    Of Jesus and His glory,

    As nothing else can do. 
    CHORUS:
    I love to tell the story, 
    'Twill be my theme in glory,

    Of Jesus and His love.

    More wonderful it seems 
    Than all the golden fancies 
    Of all our golden dreams. 
    I love to tell the story, 
    It did so much for me; 
    And that is just the reason 
    I tell it now to thee. 

    3.
    I love to tell the story; 
    'Tis pleasant to repeat
    What seems, each time I tell it, 
    More wonderfully sweet. 
    I love to tell the story, 
    For some have never heard 
    The message of salvation 
    From God's own Holy Word.

    4.
    I love to tell the story, 
    For those who know it best 
    Seem hungering and thirsting 
    To hear it like the rest. 
    And when, in scenes of glory, 
    I sing the new, new song, 
    'Twill be the old, old story
    That I have loved so long.

    How shall I follow Him I serve? 
    How shall I copy Him I love? 
    Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve 
    Which lead me to His seat above? 

    2.
    Lord, should my path through suffering lie, 
    Forbid that I should e'er repine; 
    Still let me turn to Calvary, 
    Nor heed my grief, remembering  Thine. 

    3.
    O, let me think how Thou didst leave 
    The heavenly home of pure delights, 
    To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve, 
    Through toilsome days, through lonely nights! 

    4.
    All this Thou didst, then died for me! 
    Thou camest not Thyself to please; 
    And, dear though earthly comforts be, 
    Shall I not love Thee more than these?

    Let the dying look and live;

    And the blind, who grope in darkness,
    Through the blood of Christ shall see.
    CHORUS:
    Lift Him up, the risen Savior,
    High amid the waiting throng;
    Lift Him up, 'tis He that speaketh,

    Lift Him up, this precious Savior,
    Let the multitude behold;
    They with willing hearts shall seek Him,
    He will draw them to His fold;
    They shall gather from the wayside,
    Hastening on with joyous feet,
    They shall bear the cross of Jesus,
    And shall find salvation sweet.

    3.
    Lift Him up in all His glory,
    'Tis the Son of God on high;
    Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,
    E'en the careless shall draw nigh;
    Let them hear again the story
    Of the cross, the death of shame;
    And from tongue to tongue repeat it;
    Mighty throngs shall bless His name.

    4.
    O then lift Him up in singing,
    Lift the Savior up in prayer;
    He, the glorious Redeemer,
    All the sins of men did bear;
    Yes, the young shall bow before Him,
    And the old their voices raise;
    All the deaf shall hear hosannah;
    And the dumb shall shout His praise.

    Days of toil and hours of ease,
    Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,

    To say, "I love my Saviour 
    Who gave His life for me."

    And if your faith be dim, 
    Arise in all your weakness, 
    And leave the rest to Him.

    So kind, and true, and tender,

    What power my soul can sever?
    Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?
    No; I am His forever.

    I could not live apart from Him, 
    I love to feel Him nigh; 
    And so we dwell together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    2.
    Sometimes I'm faint and weary, 
    He knows that I am weak; 
    And as He bids me lean on Him, 
    His help I'll gladly seek; 
    He leads me in the path of light, 
    Beneath a sunny sky; 
    And so we walk together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    3.
    I tell Him all my sorrows, 
    I tell Him all my joys, 
    I tell Him all that pleases me, 
    I tell Him what annoys; 
    He tells me what I ought to do, 
    Hs tells me how to try; 
    And so we talk together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    4.
    He knows how I am longing 
    Some weary soul to win, 
    And so He bids me go and speak 
    The loving word for Him; 
    He bids me tell His wondrous love, 
    And why He came to die; 
    And so we work together, 
    My Lord and I.

    1.
    Tell me the story of Jesus, 
    Write on my heart every word, 
    Tell me the story most precious 
    Sweetest that ever was heard; 
    Tell how the angels in chorus, 
    Sang as they welcomed His birth. 
    Glory to God in the highest, 
    Peace and good tidings to earth. 
    Refrain:
    Tell me the story of Jesus, 
    Write on my heart every word, 
    Tell me the story most precious, 
    Sweetest that ever was heard. 

    2.
    Fasting alone in the desert, 
    Tell of the days that He passed, 
    How for our sins He was tempted, 
    Yet was triumphant at last; 
    Tell of the years of His labor, 
    Tell of the sorrow He bore. 
    He was despised and afflicted, 
    Homeless, rejected and poor. 

    3.
    Tell of the cross where they nailed Him, 
    Writhing in anguish and pain; 
    Tell of the grave where they laid Him, 
    Tell how He liveth again; 
    Love in that story so tender, 
    Clearer than ever I see; 
    Stay, let me weep while you whisper, 
    Love paid the ransom for me.

    1.
    "'Tis finished!" so the Saviour cried, 
    And meekly bowed His head, and died; 
    'Tis finished! yes, the race is run, 
    The battle fought, the victory won. 

    2.
    'Tis finished! that which heaven foretold 
    By prophets in the days of old; 
    And truths are opened to our view 
    That kings and prophets never knew.

    3.
    'Tis finished! Son of God, Thy power 
    Hath triumphed in this awful hour; 
    And yet our eyes with sorrow see 
    That life to us was death to Thee.

    4.
    'Tis finished! let the joyful sound 
    Be heard through all the nations round; 
    'Tis finished! let the triumph rise, 
    And swell the chorus of the skies!

    1.
    It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,

    That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory
    To receive from the world His own.
    Refrain:
    O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
    Ere we shout the glad song?
    Christ returneth, Hallelujah!
    Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.

    2.
    It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,
    It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
    Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
    When Jesus receives His own.

    3.
    O joy! O delight! should we go without dying,
    No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,
    Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
    When Jesus receives His own.

    1.
    When Jesus shall gather the nations, 
    Before Him at last to appear, 
    Then how shall we stand in the judgment, 
    When summoned our sentence to hear? 
    Refrain:
    He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
    But the chaff will He scatter away; 
    Then how shall we stand in the judgment 
    Of the great resurrection day? 

    2.
    Shall we hear, from the lips of the Saviour, 
    The words "Faithful servant, well done," 
    Or, trembling with fear and with anguish, 
    Be banished away from His throne? 

    3.
    He will smile when He looks on His children, 
    And sees on the ransomed His seal; 
    He will clothe them in heavenly beauty, 
    As low at His footstool they kneel. 

    4.
    Then let us be watching and waiting, 
    With lamps burning steady and bright; 
    When the Bridegroom shall call to the wedding, 
    O may we be ready for flight! 

    5.
    Thus living with hearts fixed on heaven, 
    In patience we wait for the time 
    When, the days of our pilgrimage ended, 
    We'll bask in the presence divine.

    O the rapture of His people!

    They will share the life immortal, 
    They will know as they are known, 
    They will pass the pearly portal, 
    When the King shall claim His own. 

    3.
    Long they've toiled within the harvest, 
    Sown the precious seed with tears; 
    Soon they'll drop their heavy burdens 
    In the glad millennia I years; 
    They will share the bliss of heaven, 
    Nevermore to sigh or moan; 
    Starry crowns will then be given, 
    When the King shall claim His own. 

    4.
    We shall greet the loved and loving, 
    Who have left us lonely here; 
    Every heartache will be banished 
    When the Saviour shall appear; 
    Never grieved with sin or sorrow, 
    Never weary or alone; 

    0. we long for that glad morrow 
    When the King shall claim His own.

    But we know not the hour.
    CHORUS:
    He will come (He will come), let us watch and be ready;
    He will come (He will come), hallelujah! hallelujah!
    He will come in the clouds of His Father's bright glory--
    But we know not the hour.

    2.
    There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
    There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
    Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
    But we know not the hour.

    3.
    We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;

    1.
    We know not the time when he cometh, 
    At even, or midnight, or morn; 
    It may be at deepening twilight, 
    It may be at earliest dawn. 
    He bids us to watch and be ready, 
    Nor suffer our lights to grow dim; 
    That, when he may come, he will find us 
    All waiting and watching for him. 
    Refrain:
    Waiting and watching, 
    Waiting and watching, 
    Waiting and watching, 
    Still waiting and watching for him. 

    2.
    I think of his wonderful pity, 
    The price our salvation hath cost; 
    He left the bright mansions of glory 
    To suffer and die for the lost. 
    And, sometimes, I think it will please him, 
    When those whom he died to redeem, 
    Rejoice in the hope of his coming, 
    By waiting and watching for him. 

    3.
    O Jesus, my loving Redeemer, 
    Thou knowest I cherish as dear 
    The hope that mine eyes shall behold thee, 
    That I shall thine own welcome hear. 
    If to some as a judge thou appearest, 
    Who forth from thy presence would flee, 
    A Friend most beloved I'll greet thee; 
    I'm waiting and watching for thee.

    Once the Lamb for sinners slain; 
    Tell, tell the wondrous story, 
    'Jesus comes to reign.'

    Then let us rally, and fresh courage take; 
    Soon will we hear our dear Lord's loving voice;

    Soon the pearly gates will enter'sing and rejoice.

    We'll dwell the countless ages through;

    Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;
    Earth her latest pangs is summing;

    5.
    Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
    Now for you He's interceding;
    Haste, ere grace and time diminished
    Shall proclaim the mystery finished.

    While the years of eternity roll. 

    2.
    O, that home of the soul! in my visions and dreams 
    Its bright, jasper walls I can see, 
    Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes 
    Between the fair city and me, 
    Between the fair city and me; 
    Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes 
    Between the fair city and me. 

    3.
    That unchangeable home is for you and for me, 
    Where Jesus of Nazareth stands; 
    The King of all kingdoms forever is He, 
    And He holdeth our crowns in His hands, 
    And He holdeth our crowns in His hands; 
    The King of all kingdoms forever is He, 
    And He holdeth our crowns in His hands. 

    4.
    O, how sweet it will be in that beautiful land, 
    So free from all sorrow and pain; 
    With songs on our lips and with harps in our hands, 
    To meet one another again! 
    To meet one another again! 
    With songs on our lips and with harps in our hands, 
    To meet one another again!

    To Canaan's fair and happy land,
    Where my possessions lie.
    CHORUS:
    I am bound for the promised land,
    I am bound for the promised land;
    O who will come and go with me?
    I am bound for the promised land.

    2.
    O'er all those wide extended plains
    Shines one eternal day;
    There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,
    And scatters night away.

    3.
    When shall I reach that happy place,
    And be forever blest?
    When shall I see my Father's face,
    And in His kingdom rest?

    4.
    Filled with delight, my raptured soul
    Would here no longer stay;
    Though Jordan's waves around me roll,
    Fearless I'd launch away.

    1.
    There is a land of corn and wine, 
    And all its joys will soon be mine; 
    There shines undimmed one blissful day, 
    For earth's dark night has passed away. 
    REFRAIN:
    O Beulah land! sweet Beulah land! 
    Upon thy heights I long to stand, 
    And view the radiant, jasper sea, 
    And mansions fair, prepared for me, 
    And find on that eternal shore 
    My heaven, my home, forevermore. 

    2.
    My Saviour then will walk with me; 
    O sweet communion that will be! 
    He'll gently lead me by the hand, 
    In that celestial, happy land. 

    3.
    A sweet perfume upon the breeze, 
    Will come from ever vernal trees, 
    And flowers that never fading grow, 
    Where streams of life forever flow. 

    4.
    The zephyrs then will laden be 
    With sounds of sweetest melody, 
    As angels, with the ransomed throng, 
    Join in the sweet redemption song.

    With its crystal tide forever
    Flowing by the throne of God?

    Lay we every burden down;
    Grace our spirits will deliver,
    And provide a robe and crown.

    4.
    Soon we'll reach the shining river,
    Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
    Soon our happy hearts will quiver
    With the melody of peace.

    Would I seek Thy face; 
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit,

    Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
    Whom in heaven but Thee?

    1.
    I've wandered far away from God, 
    Now I'm coming home; 
    The paths of sin too long I've trod; 
    Lord, I'm coming home. 
    REFRAIN:
    Coming home, coming home, 
    Nevermore to roam, 
    Open wide Thine arms of love, 
    Lord, I'm coming home. 

    2.
    I've wasted many precious years,

    Lord, I'm coming home. 

    3.
    I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord, 
    Now I'm coming home; 
    I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy Word; 
    Lord, I'm coming home. 

    4.
    My only hope, my only plea, 
    Now I'm coming home; 
    That Jesus died, and died for me; 
    Lord, I'm coming home. 

    5.
    I need His cleansing blood I know, 
    Now I'm coming home; 
    O wash me whiter than the snow; 
    Lord, I'm coming home.

    1.
    There is a gate that stands ajar, 
    And through its portals gleaming, 
    A radiance from the cross afar, 
    The Saviour's love revealing. 
    REFRAIN:
    O depth of mercy! can it be 
    That gate was left ajar for me? 
    For me, for me? 
    Was left ajar for me? 

    2.
    That gate ajar stands free for all 
    Who seek through it salvation; 
    The rich and poor, the great and small 
    Of every tribe and nation. 

    3.
    Press onward, then, though foes may frown; 
    While mercy's gate is open 
    Accept the cross, and win the crown, 
    Love's everlasting token. 

    4.
    Beyond the river's brink we'll lay 
    The cross that here is given, 
    And bear the crown of life away, 
    And love Him more in heaven.

    O weary soul, the gate is near,

    Just outside the door, just outside the door, 
    Behold, it stands ajar! 
    Just outside the door, just outside the door, 
    So near and yet so far! 

    2.
    Forgiveness Jesus will impart, 
    To save your soul He died; 
    How can you still offend His heart 
    By staying just outside? 

    3.
    The day of life is passing by; 
    Soon night your soul will hide; 
    And then "Too late" will be your cry, 
    If you are just outside! 

    4.
    Come in, be free from stains of sin, 
    Be glad, be satisfied; 
    Before the tempest breaks, come in, 
    And leave your past outside.

    Mercies for you and for me? 

    3.
    Think of the wonderful love He has promised, 
    Promised for you and for me! 
    Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon, 
    Pardon for you and for me.

    He can pardon this rebel heart; 
    Shall I bid Him forever depart,

    Yes, I'll open this proud heart's door, 
    Yes, I'll let Him in.

    Blessed Saviour, abide with me, 
    Cares and trials will lighter be; 
    I am safe if I'm only with Thee, 
    O, blessed Lord, come in!

    Vainly will strive when the door is barred, 
    Someone will fail of the saints' reward; 
    Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I? 

    4.
    Someone will sing the triumphant song 
    By and by, by and by, 
    Join in the praise with the blood bought throng;

    O tender and sweet was the Father's voice 
    As He lovingly called to me, 
    "Come over the line, it is only a step; 
    I'm waiting, My child, for thee." 
    Refrain:
    "Over the line," hear the sweet refrain; 
    Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
    "Over the line"'Why should I remain 
    With a step between me and Jesus? 

    2.
    "But my sins are so many, my faith so small"' 
    Lo! the answer came quick and clear, 
    "Thou needest not trust in thyself at all; 
    Step over the line. I'm here." 

    3.
    "But my flesh is so feeble," with tears I said, 
    "And the pathway I cannot see; 
    I fear if I try I may sadly fail, 
    And thus dishonor Thee." 

    4.

    But we never can prove
    The delights of His love
    Until all on the altar we lay;
    For the favor He shows,
    And the joy He bestows,
    Are for them who will trust and obey.

    5.
    Then in fellowship sweet
    We will sit at His feet,
    Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
    What He says we will do,
    Where He sends we will go;
    Never fear, only trust and obey.

    1.
    Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,

    Refrain:

    It will firmly hold in the straits of Fear, 
    When the breakers tell that the reef is near; 
    Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow, 
    Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow. 

    4.
    It will surely hold in the floods of death, 
    When the waters cold chill our latest breath; 
    On the rising tide it can never fail, 
    While our hopes abide within the veil. 

    5.
    When our eyes behold, in the dawning light, 
    Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright, 
    We shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore, 
    With the storms all past forevermore.

    4.
    A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?

    Is my name written there? 

    2.
    Lord, my sins they are many, 
    Like the sands of the sea, 
    But Thy blood, O my Saviour, 
    Is sufficient for me; 
    For Thy promise is written 
    In bright letters that glow, 
    "Though Your sins be as scarlet, 
    I will make them like snow." 

    3.
    Oh, that beautiful city, 
    With its mansions of light, 
    With its glorified beings 
    In pure garments of white; 
    Where no evil thing cometh 
    To despoil what is fair, 
    Where the angels are watching' 
    Is my name written there?
 
 

## 618.  Sitting at the Feet of Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127CusuT_53ZgFg6ggcb%2DcRbHSCgewi8U/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus, 
    O what words I hear Him say! 
    Happy place! so near, so precious! 
    May it find me there each day; 
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus, 
    I would look upon the past, 
    For His love has been so gracious, 
    It has won my heart at last. 

    2.
    Sitting at the feel of Jesus, 
    Where can mortal be more blest? 
    There I lay my sins and sorrows, 
    And, when weary, find sweet rest; 
    Silting at the feet of Jesus, 
    There I love to weep and pray, 
    While I from His fullness gather 
    Grace and comfort every day. 

    3.
    Bless me, O my Saviour, bless me, 
    As I'm waiting at Thy feet, 
    O look down in love upon me, 
    Let me see Thy face so sweet; 
    Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus, 
    Make me holy as He is, 
    May I prove I've been with Jesus, 
    Who is all my righteousness.

    1.
    Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
    Every soul a warning give;
    Whosoever hears the message
    May repent, and, turn and live.
    CHORUS:
    Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
    Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
    God commissions, sound the message!
    Every captive may be free.

    2.
    Sound it loud o'er every hilltop,
    Gloomy shade and sunny plain;
    Ocean depths repeat the message,
    Full salvation's glad refrain.

    3.
    Sound it in the hedge and highway,
    Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
    Let it tell all things are ready,
    Father waits to welcome home.

    4.
    Sound it for the heavy laden,
    Weary, longing to be free;
    Sound a Savior's invitation,
    Sweetly saying, Come to me.
 
 

## 620.  'O Where Are the Reapers?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gPv6CbdeZaXhUXTPH%2DEKjcp8QvwPfYw/edit?mode=html)



    Major Key: G

    1.
    O where are the reapers that garner in
    The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?
    With sickles of truth must the work be done,
    And no one may rest till the harvest home.
    CHORUS:
    Where are the reapers? O who will come
    And share in the glory of the harvest home?
    O who will help us to garner in
    The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?

    2.
    The fields all are ripening, and far and wide
    The world now is waiting the harvest tide:
    But reapers are few, and the work is great,
    And much will be lost should the harvest wait.

    3.
    So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,
    And gather together the golden grain;
    Toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,
    Then share ye His joy in the harvest home.

    1.
    Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
    Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve,

    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
    CHORUS:
    Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
    Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

    2.
    Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
    Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
    By and by the harvest and the labor ended -
    We shall come rejoicing, bringin in the sheaves.

    3.
    Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
    Tho the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
    When our weeping's over He will bid us welcome -
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12u_qbkPGe_c9Rom2MOWAxHuHWLImh8YH/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    One more day's work for Jesus, 
    One less of life for me; 
    But heaven is nearer, 
    And Christ is dearer, 
    Than yesterday to me; 
    His love and light 
    Fill all my soul tonight. 
    Refrain:
    One more day's work for Jesus, 
    One more day's work for Jesus, 
    One more day's work for Jesus, 
    One less of life for me. 

    2.
    One more day's work for Jesus; 
    How glorious is my King! 
    Tis joy, not duty, 
    To speak His beauty; 
    My soul mounts on the wing 
    At the mere thought 
    How Christ my life has bought. 

    3.
    One more day's work for Jesus; 
    How sweet the work has been, 
    To tell the story, 
    To show the glory, 
    When Christ's flock enter in! 
    How it did shine 
    In this poor heart of mine! 

    4.
    One more day's work for Jesus' 
    O yes, a weary day; 
    But heaven shines clearer, 
    And rest comes nearer, 
    At each step of the way, 
    And Christ in all' 
    Before His face I fall. 

    5.
    O blessed work for Jesus! 
    O rest at Jesus' feet! 
    There toil seems pleasure, 
    My wants are treasure, 
    And pain for Him is sweet. 
    Lord, if I may, 
    I'll serve another day.
 
 

## 623.  Rescue the Perishing

    1.
    Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
    Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
    Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
    Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
    CHORUS:
    Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
    Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

    2.
    Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive;
    Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.

    3.
    Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
    Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
 
 

## 624.  Throw Out the Life Line
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12hcXCDPsmLsWannWeaV4a2qf0A6JvgBo/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Throw out the life line across the dark wave, 
    There is a brother whom someone should save; 
    Somebody's brother! oh, who then will dare 
    To throw out the life line, his peril to share? 
    Refrain:
    Throw out the life line! 
    Throw out the life line! 
    Someone is drifting away! 
    Throw out the life line! 
    Throw out the life line! 
    Someone is sinking today. 

    2.
    Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong; 
    Why do you tarry, why linger so long? 
    See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today 
    And out with the lifeboat! away, then, away! 

    3.
    Throw out the life line to danger fraught men, 
    Sinking in anguish where you've never been; 
    Winds of temptation and billows of woe 
    Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow. 

    4.
    Soon will the season of rescue be o'er, 
    Soon will they drift to eternity's shore; 
    Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay, 
    But throw out the life line and save them today.

    1.
    Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
    Out in the desert dark and drear,
    Calling the sheep who've gone astray,
    Far from the Shepherd's fold away.
    CHORUS:
    Bring them in, Bring them in,
    Bring them in from the fields of sin;
    Bring them in, Bring them in,
    Bring the wanderers to Jesus.

    2.
    Who'll go and help the Shepherd kind,
    Help Him the wandering ones to find?
    Who'll bring them back into the fold,
    Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

    3.
    Out in the desert hear their cry,
    Out on the mountain wild and high,
    Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
    Go, find My sheep where 'er they be.

    1.
    I am thinking today of that beautiful land 
    I shall reach when the sun goeth down; 
    When through wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand, 
    Will there be any stars in my crown? 
    Refrain:
    Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown, 
    When at evening the sun goeth down? 
    When I wake with the blest 
    In the mansions of rest, 
    Will there be any stars in my crown? 

    2.
    In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray, 
    Let me watch as a winner of souls; 
    That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day. 
    When His praise like the sea billows rolls. 

    3.
    O what joy will it be when His face I behold. 
    Living gems at His feet to lay down; 
    It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold, 
    Should there be any stars in my crown.

    1.
    He that goeth forth with weeping,
    Bearing precious seed in love, 
    Never tiring, never sleeping, 
    Findeth mercy from above. 

    2.
    Soft descend the dews of heaven, 
    Bright the rays celestial shine; 
    Precious fruits will thus be given, 
    Through an influence all divine. 

    3.
    Sow the seed, be never weary; 
    Let no fears thy soul annoy; 
    Be the prospect ne'er so dreary, 
    Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy. 

    4.
    Lo, the scene of verdure brightening! 
    See the rising grain appear; 
    Look again! the fields are whitening, 
    For the harvest time is near.

    1.
    Brightly beams our Father's mercy, 
    From His lighthouse evermore, 
    But to us He gives the keeping 
    Of the lights along the shore. 
    Refrain:
    Let the lower lights be burning! 
    Send a gleam across the wave! 
    Some poor fainting, struggling seaman 
    You may rescue, you may save. 

    2.
    Dark the night of sin has settled, 
    Loud the angry billows roar; 
    Eager eyes are watching, longing, 
    For the lights along the shore. 

    3.
    Trim You feeble lamp, my brother: 
    Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, 
    Trying now to make the harbor, 
    In the darkness may be lost.

    And tell the story'Saved by grace;

    1.
    I'm pressing on the upward way, 
    New heights I'm gaining every day; 
    Still praying as I onward bound, 
    'Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.' 
    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand 
    By faith on heaven's tableland; 
    A higher plane than I have found; 
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. 

    2.
    My heart has no desire to stay 
    Where doubts arise and fears dismay; 
    Though some may dwell where these abound, 
    My prayer, my aim, is higher ground. 

    3.
    I want to live above the world, 
    Though Satan's darts at me are hurled; 
    For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
    The song of saints on higher ground. 

    4.
    I want to scale the utmost height, 
    And catch a gleam of glory bright; 
    But still I'll pray till heaven I've found, 
    'Lord, lead me on to higher ground.'

    Closer draw me,

    1.
    O sometimes the shadows are deep, 
    And rough seems the path to the goal; 
    And sorrows, how often they sweep 
    Like tempests down over the soul! 
    Refrain:
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I. 
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I. 

    2.
    O sometimes how long seems the day, 
    And sometimes how heavy my feet; 
    But toiling in life's dusty way, 
    The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet!

    O near to the Rock let me keep, 
    Or blessings or sorrows prevail; 
    Or climbing the mountain way steep,

    1.
    One thing I of the Lord desire, 
    For all my paths have miry been, 
    Be it by water or by fire, 
    O make me clean, 
    O make me clean. 
    Refrain:
    So wash me Thou, without, within, 
    Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
    No matter how, if only sin 
    Die out in me, die out in me. 

    2.
    If clearer vision Thou impart, 
    Grateful and glad my soul shall be; 
    But yet to have a purer heart, 
    Is more to me, 
    Is more to me. 

    3.
    Yea, only as this heart is clean 
    May larger vision yet be mine, 
    For mirrored in Thy life are seen 
    The things divine, 
    The things divine 

    4.
    I watch to shun the miry way, 
    And stanch the springs of guilty thought, 
    But watch and struggle as I may, 
    Pure I am not, 
    Pure I am not.

    O why is Thine apparel, 
    With reeking gore all dyed, 
    Like them that tread the wine press red? 
    O why this bloody tide? 
    "I the wine press trod alone, 
    'Neath darkening skies; 
    Of the people there was none 
    Mighty to save." 

    3.
    O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour! 
    How could'st Thou bear this shame? 
    With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought 
    Salvation in My name; 
    I the bloody fight have won, 
    Conquered the grave, 
    Now the year of joy has come' 
    Mighty to save."

    When the heart for mercy craves, 
    Sing in triumph o'er the tomb, 
    Jesus saves, Jesus saves. 

    4.

    But aye the fadeless morn;
    I'm sighing for homeland,
    My heart is aching here;
    There is no pain in the homeland
    To which I'm drawing near;
    There is no pain in the homeland
    To which I'm drawing near.

    2.
    My Lord is in the homeland,
    With angels bright and fair;
    There's no sin in the homeland,
    And no temptation there;
    The music of the homeland
    Is ringing in my ears;
    And when I think of the homeland
    My eyes are filled with tears;
    And when I think of the homeland
    My ears are filled with tears.

    3.
    The dwellers in the homeland
    Are beckoning me to come,
    Where neither death nor sorrow
    Invades their holy name;
    O dear, dear native country!
    O rest and peace above!
    Christ bring us all to the homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love;
    Christ bring us all to the homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love

    1.
    Come, we that love the Lord,
    And let our joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus surround the throne,
    And thus surround the throne.
    CHORUS:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

    2.
    Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But children of the heav'nly King,
    But children of the heav'nly King
    May speak their joys abroad,
    May speak their joys abroad.

    3.
    The hill of Zion yields
    A thousand sacred sweets
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields
    Or walk the golden streets,
    Or walk the golden streets.

    4.
    Then let our songs abound
    And ev'ry tear be dry;
    We're marching thru Immanuel's ground,
    We're marching thru Immanuel's ground
    To fairer worlds on high,
    To fairer worlds on high.

    1.
    When all my labors and trials are o'er, 
    And I am safe on that beautiful shore, 
    Just to be near the dear Lord I adore, 
    Will through the ages be glory for me. 
    Refrain:

    Glory for me, glory for me; 
    When by His grace I shall look on His face, 
    That will be glory, be glory for me. 

    2.
    When, by the gift of His infinite grace, 
    I am accorded in Heaven a place, 
    Just to be there and to look on His face, 
    Will through the ages be glory for me. 

    3.
    Friends will be there I have loved long ago;

    Will through the ages be glory for me.
 
 

## 642.  Just Over the Mountains
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vvueKUTN8tOxFreuGvmcZlYHBwg2_CA/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Just over the mountains in the Promised Land, 
    Lies the holy city built by God's own hand; 
    As our weary footsteps gain the mountain's crest, 
    We can view our homeland of eternal rest. 
    Refrain:
    We are nearing home! We are nearing home! 
    See the splendor gleaming from the domes afar! 
    See the glory streaming through the "gates ajar!" 
    There we soon will enter, nevermore to roam, 
    Hear the angels singing! 
    We are nearing home! 
    We are nearing home. 

    2.
    In the rolls of the prophets we have long been told 
    Of that wondrous city with its streets of gold; 
    Now with raptured vision we can see it there, 
    With its walls of jasper and its mansions fair. 

    3.
    Those who enter that city are the faithful few 
    Who keep God's commandments'faith of Jesus, too; 
    There we'll lift our voices through the endless days, 
    In sweet songs of gladness and in psalms of praise. 

    4.
    My brother, my sister, will you meet us there, 
    In that land of sunshine where there'll be no care? 
    Accept of God's message, and to Him be true; 
    Then when Jesus cometh He will call for you.

    3.
    That name I fondly love to hear, 
    It never fails my heart to cheer, 
    Its music dries the falling tear; 
    Exalt the name of Jesus. 

    4.
    No word of man can ever tell 
    How sweet the name I love so well; 
    Oh, let its praises ever swell; 
    Oh, praise the name of Jesus.

    This is my Father's world,
    and to my listening ears
    all nature sings, and round me rings
    the music of the spheres.
    This is my Father's world:
    I rest me in the thought
    of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
    his hand the wonders wrought.

    2.
    This is my Father's world,
    the birds their carols raise,
    the morning light, the lily white,
    declare their maker's praise.
    This is my Father's world:
    he shines in all that's fair;
    in the rustling grass I hear him pass;
    he speaks to me everywhere.

    3.
    This is my Father's world.
    O let me ne'er forget
    that though the wrong seems oft so strong,
    God is the ruler yet.
    This is my Father's world:
    why should my heart be sad?
    The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
    God reigns; let the earth be glad!

    1.
    My glorious Victor, Prince Divine, 
    Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
    At length my will is all Thine own, 
    Glad vassal of a Saviour's throne. 

    2.
    My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
    Pierce this now willing ear once more. 
    Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
    With Thee, to toil, endure, obey. 

    3.
    Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will, 
    Use all in Thy dear slavery still! 
    Self's weary liberties I cast 
    Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast. 

    4.
    Tread them still down; and then I know 
    These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow; 
    And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
    Which tells me Thou and I are one.

    1.
    Wake the song of joy and gladness;
    Hither bring your noblest lays;
    Banish every thought of sadness,
    Pouring forth your highest praise.
    Sing to Him whose care has brought us
    Once again with friends to meet,
    And whose loving voice has taught us
    Of the way to Jesus' feet.
    Refrain:
    Wake the song, wake the song,
    The song of joy and gladness,
    Wake the song, wake the song,
    The song of Jubilee.

    2.
    Joyfully with songs and banners,
    We will greet the festal day;
    Shout aloud our glad hosannas,
    And our grateful homage pay.
    We will chant our Savior's glory
    while our thoughts we raise above,
    Telling still the old, old, story,
    Precious theme- redeeming love!

    3.
    Thanks to Thee, O holy Father,
    For the mercies of the year;
    May each heart, as here we gather,

    Thanks to Thee, O loving Savior,
    For redemption through Thy blood.
    Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit,
    Sweetly draw us near to God.

    1.
    In joyful high and holy lays 
    My soul her grateful voice would raise;

    A joy by day, a peace by night,

    Is the wonderful love of Jesus. 

    3.
    My hope for pardon when I call, 
    My trust for lifting when I fall, 
    In life, in death, my all in all, 
    Is the wonderful love of Jesus.

    1.
    A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
    A wonderful Saviour to me, 
    He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
    Where rivers of pleasure I see. 
    Refrain:
    He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
    That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
    He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
    And covers me there with His hand, 
    And covers me there with His hand. 

    2.
    A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
    He taketh my burden away; 
    He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved, 
    He giveth me strength as my day. 

    3.
    With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
    And, filled with His fulness divine, 
    I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God, 
    For such a Redeemer as mine. 

    4.
    When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
    To meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
    His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, 
    I'll shout with the millions on high.

    1.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    This is the promise of love;
    There shall be seasons refreshing,
    Sent from the Savior above.
    Refrain:
    Showers of blessing,
    Showers of blessing we need;
    Mercy drops round us are falling,
    But for the showers we plead.

    2.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    Precious reviving again;
    Over the hills and the valleys,
    Sound of abundance of rain.

    3.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    Send them upon us, O Lord;
    Grant to us now a refreshing;
    Come, and now honor Thy word.

    4.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    O that today they might fall,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13t2A%2Du7Ow41WZetI6YRYj6Rj7Vdxo5bv/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Don't forget the Sabbath, 
    The Lord our God hath blest, 
    Of all the week the brightest, 
    Of all the week the best; 
    It brings repose from labor, 
    It tells of joy divine, 
    Its beams of light descending, 
    With heavenly beauty shine. 
    Refrain:
    Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, 
    Blessed Sabbath day, 
    Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, 
    Blessed Sabbath day. 

    2.
    Keep the Sabbath holy, 
    And worship Him today, 
    Who said to His disciples, 
    "I am the living way;" 
    And if we meekly follow 
    Our Savior here below, 
    He'll give us of the fountain 
    Whose streams eternal flow. 

    3.
    Day of sacred pleasure! 
    Its golden hours we'll spend 
    In thankful hymns to Jesus, 
    The children's dearest Friend; 
    O gentle loving, Saviour, 
    How good and kind Thou art, 
    How precious is Thy promise 
    To dwell in every heart!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13klIqwS8uEolbXorRmq9kgoxdRNuk%2D48/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Holy day, Jehovah's rest, 
    Of creation's week the best; 
    Last of all the chosen seven, 
    Blessed of God, to man 'twas given. 
    Refrain:
    Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
    Glad we hail its presence blest, 
    'Tis the great Jehovah's rest. 

    2.
    First His six days' work was done, 
    Then the Sabbath was begun; 
    Thus He blessed the seventh day, 
    Thus in resting we obey. 

    3.
    Thousands have His plan reversed, 
    Resting now upon the first; 
    Search the Book and you shall know 
    There's no scripture tells them so. 

    4.
    All who speak the truth must say 
    It was man who changed the day; 
    In God's word no change appears 
    Through the whole six thousand years! 
    Thus I searched; and when I saw 
    Only one great Sabbath law, 
    Then I hastened to obey' 
    Plainly, 'twas the only way.

    1.
    Give me the Bible,
    Star of gladness gleaming,
    To cheer the wanderer
    Lone and tempest tossed,
    No storm can hide that
    Peaceful radiance beaming
    Since Jesus came
    To seek and save the lost.
    CHORUS:
    Give me the Bible--
    Holy message shining,
    Thy light shall guide me
    In the narrow way.
    Precept and promise,
    Law and love combining,
    'Til night shall vanish
    In eternal day.

    2.
    Give me the Bible
    When my heart is broken,
    When sin and grief have
    Filled my soul with fear,
    Give me the precious
    Words by Jesus spoken,
    Hold up faith's lamp
    To show my Savior near.

    3.
    Give me the Bible,
    All my steps enlighten,
    Teach me the danger
    Of these realms below,
    That lamp of safety,
    O'er the gloom shall brighten,
    That light alone
    The path of peace can show.

    1.
    A glory in the word we find 
    When grace restores our sight; 
    But sin has darkened all the mind, 
    And veiled the heavenly light, 
    And veiled the heavenly light. 

    2.
    When God's own Spirit clears our view, 
    How bright the doctrines shine! 
    Their holy fruits and sweetness show 
    The author is divine, 
    The author is divine. 

    3.
    How blest are we, with open face 
    To view Thy glory, Lord, 
    And all Thy image here to trace, 
    Reflected in Thy word! 
    Reflected in Thy word! 

    4.
    O teach us, as we look, to grow 
    In holiness and love. 
    That we may long to see and know 
    Thy glorious face above, 
    Thy glorious face above.

    1.
    On the shore beyond the sea, 
    Where the fields are bright and fair, 
    There's a call, a plaintive plea, 
    I must hasten to be there. 
    Refrain:
    Let me go, I cannot stay, 
    'Tis the Master calling me; 
    Let me go, I must obey; 
    Native land, farewell to thee. 

    2.
    Hark! I hear the Master say, 
    "Up, ye reapers! why so slow?" 
    To the vineyard, far away, 
    Earthly kindred, let me go. 

    3.
    Just beyond the rolling tide, 
    The uplifted hand I see; 
    Lo! the gates are open wide, 
    And the lost are calling me. 

    4.
    Father, mother, darling child, 
    I must bid you all adieu; 
    Far across the waters wild, 
    There's a work for me to do.

    I'm but a stranger here,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Earth is a desert drear,
    Heav'n is my home.
    Danger and sorrow stand
    Round me on every hand;
    Heav'n is my fatherland,
    Heav'n is my home.

    2.
    What though the tempest rage,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Short is my pilgrimage,
    Heav'n is my home;
    And time's wild wintry blast
    Soon shall be over past;
    I shall reach home at last,
    Heav'n is my home.

    3.
    There at my Savior's side
    Heav'n is my home;

## 660.  How tedious and Tasteless the Hours
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13RqajDih9TUxdusZQUSkGkzWlYqvWUKN/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How tedious and tasteless the hours 
    When Jesus no longer I see! 
    Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flowers 
    Have all lost their sweetness to me. 
    The midsummer sun shines but dim; 
    The fields strive in vain to look gay; 
    But when I am happy in Him, 
    December's as pleasant as May. 

    2.
    His name yields the richest perfume, 
    And sweeter than music His voice; 
    His presence disperses my gloom, 
    And makes all within me rejoice; 
    I should, were He always thus nigh, 
    Have nothing to wish or to fear; 
    No mortal so happy as I, 
    My summer would last all the year. 

    3.
    Content with beholding His face, 
    My all to His pleasure resigned, 
    No changes of season or place 
    Would make any change in my mind. 
    While blest with a sense of His love, 
    A palace a toy would appear; 
    And prisons would palaces prove, 
    If Jesus would dwell with me there. 

    4.
    Dear Lord, if indeed I am Thine, 
    If Thou art my sun and my song, 
    Say, why do I languish and pine? 
    And why are my winters so long? 
    O drive these dark clouds from my sky; 
    Thy soul-cheering presence restore; 
    Or take me unto Thee on high,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgS23m%2Di83a3wC3ogfIoNthn00ITHfPT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Out on an ocean all boundless we ride, 
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 
    Tossed on the waves of a rough, rest less tide, 
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 
    Far from the safe, quiet harbor we've rode, 
    Seeking our Father's celestial abode, 
    Promise of which on us each is be stowed, 
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 

    2.
    Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars. 
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound; 
    Look! yonder lie the bright heavenly shores, 
    We're homeward bound. homeward bound. 
    Steady, O pilot! stand firm at the wheel; 
    Steady, we soon shall out weather the gale; 
    O, how we fly 'neath the loud-creaking sail! 
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 

    3.
    Into the harbor of heaven now we glide, 
    We're home at last, home at last; 
    Softly we drift on its bright silver tide, 
    We're home at last, home at last. 
    Glory to God! all our dangers are o'er, 
    We stand secure on the glorified shore; 
    Glory to God! we shall shout ever more; 
    We're home at last, home at last.

    1.
    Let others seek a home below, 
    We'll be gathered home; 
    Which flames devour or waves o'er throw, 
    We'll be gathered home. 
    Refrain:
    We'll work till Jesus comes, 
    We'll work till Jesus comes, 
    We'll work till Jesus comes, 
    And we'll be gathered home. 

    2.
    Be mine the happier lot to own, 
    We'll be gathered home; 
    A heavenly mansion near the throne, 
    We'll be gathered home. 

    3.
    Then, fail this earth, let stars decline, 
    We'll be gathered home; 
    And sun and moon refuse to shine, 
    We'll be gathered home. 

    4.
    Though desolation here may be, 
    We'll be gathered home; 
    That heavenly mansion stands for me, 
    We'll be gathered home.
 
 

## 663.  'Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zgkiSuVJEJ6Yub6bhUGV4CI4UKkDeclD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Gracious Father, guard Thy children 
    From the foe's destructive power; 
    Save, O save them, Lord, from falling 
    In this dark and trying hour. 
    Thou wilt surely prove Thy people, 
    All our graces must be tried; 
    But Thy Word illumes our pathway, 
    And in God we still confide. 

    2.
    We are in the time of waiting; 
    Soon we shall behold our Lord, 
    Wafted far away from sorrow, 
    To receive our rich reward. 
    Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing, 
    Pure, unspotted, from the world; 
    Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us 
    Till Thy banner is unfurled. 

    3.
    With what joyful exultation 
    Shall the saints Thy banner see, 
    When the Lord for whom we've waited 
    Shall proclaim the jubilee! 
    Freedom from this world's pollutions; 
    Freedom from all sin and pain; 
    Freedom from the wiles of Satan, 
    And from death's destructive reign.
 
 

## 664.  Long Upon the Mountains
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbyx30_Si_YnnZndOAfZCeJwmKzv%2DXwC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Long upon the mountains weary, 
    Have the scattered flocks been torn; 
    Dark the dessert paths, and dreary; 
    Grievous trials have they borne. 
    Now the gathering call is sounding, 
    Solemn in its warning voice; 
    Union, faith, and love, abounding, 
    Bid the little flock rejoice. 

    2.
    Now the light of truth they're seeking, 
    In its onward track pursue; 
    All the ten commandments keeping, 
    They are holy, just, and true. 
    On the words of lire they're feeding, 
    Precious to their taste so sweet; 
    All their Master's percepts heeding, 
    Bowing humbly to His feet. 

    3.
    In that world of light and beauty, 
    In that golden city fair, 
    Soon its pearly gates they'll enter, 
    And of all its glories share. 
    There, divine the soul's expansions; 
    Free from sin, and death, and pain; 
    Tear will never dim those mansions 
    Where the saints immortal reign. 

    4.
    Soon He comes! With clouds descending; 
    All His saints, entombed arise; 
    The redeemed, in anthems blending, 
    Shout their victory through the skies. 
    O, we long for Thine appearing; 
    Come, O Savior, quickly come! 
    Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering, 
    Take thy ransomed children home.
 
 

## 665.  'How Far From Home?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbhpX4K7%2DT6gaDvLJLQ0Qj6LetNfuisF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How far from home? I asked, as on
    I bent my steps-the watchman spake:
    The long, dark night is almost gone,
    The morning soon will break.
    Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,
    With Hope's bright star guiding ray,
    Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,
    In everlasting days.

    2.
    I asked the warrior on the field;
    This was his soul-inspiring song:
    With courage, bold, the sword I'll wield,
    The battle is not long.
    Then weep no more, but well endure
    The conflict, till thy work is done;
    For this we know, the prize is sure,
    When victory is won.

    3.
    I asked again; earth, sea, and sun
    Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
    Time's wasting sands are nearly run,
    Eternity is nigh.
    Then weep no more-with warning tones,
    Portentous signs are thickening round,
    The whole creation, waiting, groans,
    To hear the trumpet sound.

    4.
    Not far from home! O blessed thought!
    The traveler's lonely heart to cheer;
    Which oft a healing balm has brought,
    And dried the mourner's tear.
    Then weep no more, since we shall meet
    Where weary footsteps never roam-
    Our trials past, our joys complete,
    Safe in our Father's home.

    1.
    I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;
    Do not detain me, for I am going
    To where the fountains are ever flowing.
    CHORUS:
    I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.

    2.
    There the glory is ever shining!
    O, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
    Here in this country so dark and dreary,
    I long have wandered forlorn and weary.

    3.
    There's the city to which I journey;
    My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!
    There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
    Nor any tears there, or any dying.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrYLnZp49Jv8sRuIYv_CQKx2r%2DrCz_aL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Awake, my soul, in joyful lays, 
    And sing thy great Redeemer's praise; 
    He justly claims a song from me; 
    His lovingkindness, O how free! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how free! 

    2.
    He saw me ruined in the fall, 
    Yet loved me notwithstanding all; 
    He saved me from my lost estate; 
    His lovingkindness, O how great! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how great! 

    3.
    Though numerous hosts of mighty foes, 
    Though earth and hell my way oppose, 
    He safely leads my soul along: 
    His lovingkindness, O how strong! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how strong! 

    4.
    When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, 
    Has gathered thick and thundered loud, 
    He near my soul has always stood: 
    His lovingkindness, O how good! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how good! 

    5.
    And when earth's rightful King shall come 
    To take His ransomed people home, 
    I'll sing upon that blissful shore 
    His lovingkindness, evermore. 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, evermore.

    Major Key: F

    1.
    Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, Thy better portion trace;
    Rise from transitory things Toward heaven, thy native place;
    Sun, and moon, and stars decay; Time shall soon this earth remove;
    Rise, my soul, and haste away To seats prepared above.

    2.
    Rivers to the ocean run, Nor stay in all their course;
    Fire ascending seeks the sun; Both speed them to their source;
    So a soul that's born of God, Longs to view His glorious face,
    Forward tends to His abode To rest in His embrace.

    3.
    Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn; Press onward to the prize;
    Soon our Savior will return, Triumphant in the skies;
    Yet a season, and you know Happy entrance will be given,
    All our sorrows left below, And earth exhcanged for heaven.

    How sweet are the tidings that greet the pilgrim's ear,
    As he wanders in exile from home!
    Soon, soon will the Savior in glory appear,
    And soon will the kingdom come.
    CHORUS:
    He's coming, coming, coming soon I know,
    Coming back to this earth again;
    And the weary pilgrims will to glory go,
    When the Savior comes to reign.

    2.
    The mossy old graves where the pilgrims sleep
    Shall be open as wide as before,
    And the millions that sleep in the mighty deep
    Shall live on this earth once more.

    3.
    There we'll meet ne'er to part in our happy Eden home,
    Sweet songs of redemption we'll sing;
    From the north, from the south, all the ransomed shall come,
    And worship our heavenly King.

    4.
    Hallelujah, Amen! Hallelujah again!
    Soon, if faithful, we all shall be there;
    O, be watchful, be hopeful, be joyful till then,
    And a crown of bright glory we'll wear.

    1.
    Father, I stretch my hands to Thee; 
    No other help I know; 
    If Thou withdraw Thyself from me, 
    Ah! whither shall I go? 

    2.
    On Thy dear Son I now believe, 
    O let me feel Thy power; 
    And all my varied wants relieve, 
    In this accepted hour. 

    3.
    Author of faith! to Thee I lift 
    My weary, longing eyes; 
    O let me now receive that gift; 
    My soul without it dies. 

    4.
    Surely Thou canst not let me die; 
    O speak, and I shall live; 
    And here I will unwearied lie, 
    Till Thou Thy Spirit give. 

    5.
    How would my fainting soul rejoice 
    Could I but see Thy face! 
    Now let me hear Thy quickening voice, 
    And taste Thy pardoning grace. 

    6.
    I do believe, I now believe 
    That Jesus died for me, 
    And that He shed His precious blood 
    From sin to set me free.

    Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
    Look for the way-marks passing one by one;

    Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o'er.
    CHORUS:
    Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
    Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.
    Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;
    The journey's almost o'er.

    2.
    First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
    Then Medo-Persia's banners were unfurled;
    And after Greece held universal sway,
    Rome seized the scepter--Where are we today?

    3.
    Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
    Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
    What will the next great, glorious drama be?
    Christ and His coming, And eternity.

    The Rose has come to blossom 
    Which shall for aye endure. 
    Repeat the hymn again! 
    "To God on high be glory, 
    And peace on earth to men." 

    2.
    The Word has dwelt among us,

    Repeat the hymn again! 
    "To God on high be glory, 
    And peace on earth to men."

## 673.  There Were Ninety and Nine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14M00wbXPDGn%2DYZG0XeeSY0JOa27lGlWR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There were ninety and nine that safely lay 
    In the shelter of the fold, 
    But one was out on the hills away, 
    Far, far from the gates of gold' 
    Away on the mountains wild and bare, 
    Away from the tender shepherd's care, 
    Away from the tender shepherd's care. 

    2.
    "Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine; 
    Are they not enough for Thee?" 
    But the Shepherd made answer: "One of Mine 
    Has wandered away from Me, 
    And although the road be rough and steep, 
    I go to the desert to find My sheep, 
    I go to the desert to find My sheep." 

    3.
    But none of the ransomed ever knew 
    How deep were the waters crossed, 
    Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through 
    Ere He found His sheep that was lost. 
    Far out in the desert He heard its cry' 
    Fainting and helpless and ready to die, 
    Fainting and helpless and ready to die. 

    4.
    "Lord, whence are these blood-drops all the way 
    That mark out the mountain's track?" 
    "They were shed for one who had gone astray, 
    Ere the Shepherd could bring him back." 
    "Lord why are Thy hands so rent and torn?" 
    "They are pierced tonight by many a thorn, 
    They are pierced tonight by many a thorn." 

    5.
    But all through the mountains, thunder-riven, 
    And up from the rocky steep, 
    There rose a cry to the gate of heaven, 
    "Rejoice, I have found My sheep!" 
    And the angels sang around the throne, 
    "Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own! 
    Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"

    1.
    In heavenly love abiding, 
    No change my heart shall fear; 
    And safe is such confiding, 
    For nothing changes here. 
    The storm may roar without me, 
    My heart may low be laid, 
    But God is round about me, 
    And can I be dismayed? 
    But God is round about me, 
    And can I be dismayed? 

    2.
    Wherever He may guide me, 
    No want shall turn me back; 
    My Shepherd is besided me, 
    And nothing can I lack. 
    His wisdom ever waketh, 
    His sight is never dim, 
    He knows the way He taketh, 
    And I will walk with Him. 
    He knows the way He taketh, 
    And I will walk with Him. 

    3.
    Green pastures are before me, 
    Which yet I have not seen; 
    Bright skies will soon be o'er me, 
    Where darkest clouds have been. 
    My hope I cannot measure, 
    My path to life is free, 
    My Savior has my teasure, 
    And He will walk with me. 
    My Savior has my teasure,

    When wilt Thou save the people? 
    O God of mercy, when? 
    Not kings and lords, but nations! 
    Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
    Flowers of Thy heart, O God, are they; 
    Let them not pass, like weeds, away, 
    Their heritage a sunless day. 
    God save the people! 

    2.
    Shall crime bring crime forever, 
    Strength aiding still the strong? 
    Is it Thy will, O Father, 
    That man shall toil for wrong? 
    "No," say Thy mountains; "No," Thy skies; 
    Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise, 
    And songs be heard instead of sighs; 
    God save the people! 

    3.
    When wilt Thou save the people? 
    O God of mercy, when? 
    The people, Lord, the people, 
    Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
    God save the people; Thine they are, 
    Thy children, as Thy angels fair; 
    From vice, oppression, and despair, 
    God save the people!

    Till our rest be won, 
    And, although the way be cheerless, 
    We will follow, calm and fearless; 
    Guide us by Thy hand 
    To our fatherland. 

    2.
    If the way be drear, 
    If the foe be near, 
    Let not faithless fears o'ertake us, 
    Let not faith and hope forsake us; 
    For, through many a foe, 
    To our home we go. 

    3.
    Jesus, still lead on, 
    Till our rest be won; 
    Heavenly Leader, still direct us, 
    Still support, console, protect us, 
    Till we safely stand 
    In our fatherland.

    1.
    Master, the tempest is raging! 
    The billows are tossing high! 
    The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness; 
    No shelter or help is nigh; 
    Carest Thou not that we perish? 
    How canst Thou lie asleep, 
    When each moment so madly is threatening 
    A grave in the angry deep? 
    Refrain:
    "The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
    Peace, be still! 
    Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
    Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
    No water can swallow the ship where lies 
    The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
    They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
    Peace, be still! Peace, be still! 
    They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
    Peace, peace, be still!" 

    2.
    Master, with anguish of spirit 
    I bow in my grief today; 
    The depths of my sad heart are troubled; 
    O, waken and save, I pray! 
    Torrents of sin and of anguish 
    Sweep o'er my sinking soul; 
    And I perish! I perish I dear Master; 
    O hasten, and take control. 

    3.
    Master, the terror is over, 
    The elements sweetly rest; 
    Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored, 
    And heaven's within my breast; 
    Linger, 0 blessed Redeemer, 
    Leave me alone no more; 
    And with joy I shall make the blest harbor, 
    And rest on the blissful shore.

    1.
    Sunset and evening star, 
    And one clear call for me! 
    And may there be no moaning of the bar 
    When I put out to sea, 

    2.
    But such a tide as moving seems asleep, 
    Too full for sound and foam, 
    When that which drew from out the boundless deep 
    Turns again home. 

    3.
    Twilight and evening bell, 
    And after that the dark! 
    And may there be no sadness of fare-well 
    When I embark; 

    4.
    For, though from out our bourne of time and place 
    The flood may bear me far, 
    I hope to see my Pilot face to face 
    When I have crossed the bar. 
    Amen

    Ancient of days, who sittest throned in glory, 
    To Thee all knees are bent, all voices pray; 
    Thy love has blessed the wide world's wondrous story 
    With light and life since Eden's dawning day. 

    2.
    O Holy Father, who hast led Thy children 
    In all the ages, with the fire and cloud, 
    Through seas dry shod, through weary wastes bewildering; 
    To Thee, in reverent love, our hearts are bowed. 

    3.
    O Holy Jesus, Prince of Peace and Saviour, 
    To Thee we owe the peace that still prevails, 
    Stilling the rude wills of men's wild behavior, 
    And calming passion's fierce and stormy gales. 

    4.
    O Holy Ghost, the Lord and the Life giver, 
    Thine is the quickening power that gives increase; 
    From Thee have flowed, as from a pleasant river, 
    Our plenty, wealth, prosperity, and peace. 

    5.
    O Triune God, with heart and voice adoring, 
    Praise we the goodness that doth crown our days; 
    Pray we that Thou wilt hear us, still imploring 
    Thy love and favor kept to us al ways.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MCj6yW8UWGBTuRzeaZcVdPOeKUklm9d/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Father, I yield to Thee my life, 
    Thine only shall it be; 
    From sordid pleasures, sin and strife, 
    I turn, 0 Lord, to Thee. 
    Unfettered from all earthly ties, 
    From cruel change and scorn, 
    I haste to Thee, where shadows flee 
    Before the cloudless morn. 

    2.
    Father, I yield to Thee my love, 
    Its flickering flame is Thine. 
    Clothe with the luster of Thy love 
    Each waning beam of mine. 
    From foes and friends who ever fail, 
    O'er storm-swept seas I find 
    Within the haven of Thine arms 
    A love most wondrous kind. 

    3.
    Father, I yield to Thee my will, 
    I would submissive be, 
    Content to lean upon Thy breast 
    And hear Thee speak to me. 
    Grant me a heart in tune with Thine, 
    To see as Thou dost see, 
    That each desire, each word and thought, 
    May breathe, dear Lord, of Thee. 

    4.
    Father, I yield to Thee my all, 
    My wanderings are o'er. 
    Earth's fleeting pleasures cease to call, 
    They shall deceive no more. 
    My doubts and tears lie all behind, 
    Eternal bliss before; 
    Lost in Thy love and wholly Thine 
    I'll rest forevermore.
