    1.
    Hark! that shout of rapture high, 
    Bursting forth from yonder cloud; 
    Jesus comes, and, through the sky, 
    Angels tell their joy aloud, 
    Angels tell their joy aloud. 

    2.
    Hark! the trumpet's awful voice 
    Sounds abroad o'er sea and land; 
    Let His people now rejoice; 
    Their redemption is at hand, 
    Their redemption is at hand. 

    3.
    See, the Lord appears in view; 
    Heaven and earth before Him fly; 
    Rise, ye saints, He comes for you; 
    Rise, to meet Him in the sky, 
    Rise, to meet Him in the sky. 

    4.
    Go and dwell with Him above, 
    Where no foe can e'er molest; 
    Happy in the Saviour's love, 
    Ever blessing, ever blest, 
    Ever blessing, ever blest.
