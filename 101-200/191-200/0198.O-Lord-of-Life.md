    1.
    O lord of life, Thy kingdom is at hand, 
    Blest reign of love and liberty and light; 
    Time long foretold by seers of every land; 
    The cherished dream of watchers through the night. 

    2.
    Lo! in our hearts shines forth the morning star, 
    Shedding its luster on our darkened way; 
    And we behold, as pilgrims from afar, 
    The holy dawning of Thy perfect day. 

    3.
    Now gleams at last upon our waiting eyes 
    The glory of the kingdom that shall be; 
    When truth in conquering grandeur shall arise, 
    And Christ shall rule the world with equity. 

    4.
    Forward again we move at Thy command! 
    The flaming pillar leading on anew; 
    One in the faith of all Thy prophet band, 
    Onward we press to make the vision true.
