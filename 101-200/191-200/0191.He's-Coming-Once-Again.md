    1.
    He's coming once again, 
    To set His people free; 
    That where He is, in glory bright, 
    His saints may also be. 
    Then lift the drooping head, 
    Look up, rejoice and sing; 
    He comes, in majesty sublime, 
    Salvation's glorious King! 

    2.
    The earth shall quake with fear, 
    The heavens shall flee away; 
    And where shall guilty man appear 
    In that tremendous day? 
    No refuge then is nigh, 
    No shelter from the blast; 
    The night of vengeance veils the sky 
    When mercy's day is past. 

    3.
    His eyes of living flame 
    The wicked shall devour; 
    No tongue will lightly speak the name 
    Of Jesus in that hour. 
    No scorn, no words of hate 
    For His meek followers then; 
    But prayers and tears that come too late 
    Will mark earth's mighty men.
