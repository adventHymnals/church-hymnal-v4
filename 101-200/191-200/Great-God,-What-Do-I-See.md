    1.
    Great God, what do I see and hear! 
    The end of things created! 
    The Judge of man I see appear 
    On clouds of glory seated; 
    The trumpet sounds; the graves restore 
    The dead which they contained before; 
    Prepare, my soul, to meet Him. 

    2.
    The dead in Christ shall first arise, 
    At the last trumpet's sounding' 
    Caught up to meet Him in the skies, 
    With joy their Lord surrounding; 
    No gloomy fears their souls dismay, 
    His presence sheds eternal day 
    On those prepared to meet Him. 

    3.
    But sinners filled with guilty fears, 
    Behold His wrath prevailing; 
    For they shall rise, and find their tears 
    And sighs are unavailing; 
    The day of grace is past and gone 
    Trembling they stand before the throne, 
    All unprepared to meet Him. 

    4.
    Great God! what did I see and hear! 
    The end of things created! 
    The Judge of man I see apprear 
    On clouds of glory seated; 
    Beneath His cross I view the day 
    When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
    And thus prepare to meet Him.
