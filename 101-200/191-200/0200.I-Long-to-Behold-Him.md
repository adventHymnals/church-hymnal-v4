[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/172rWUV9nXH_lg5NQLIy1kBrPyZFhBSep/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I long to behold Him arrayed 
    With glory and light from above; 
    The King in His beauty displayed, 
    His beauty of holiest love: 
    I languish, and sigh to be there, 
    Where Jesus hath fixed His abode; 
    O, when shall we meet in the air, 
    And fly to the mountain of God? 

    2.
    With Him, I on Zion shall stand, 
    For Jesus has spoken the word; 
    The breath of Immanuel's land, 
    Survey, by the side of my Lord! 
    But when, on Thy bosom reclined, 
    Thy face I am strengthened to see, 
    My fullness of rapture I find, 
    My heaven of heavens, in Thee. 

    3.
    How happy the people whose home 
    Is found in the city of God! 
    As pilgrims no more they shall roam, 
    Nor travel a dangerous road. 
    Physician divine, unto me 
    Thy soul-healing blessing now give, 
    And keep me while waiting for Thee, 
    And then to that city receive.
