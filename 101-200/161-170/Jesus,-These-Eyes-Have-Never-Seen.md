[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CjbkYhaQom191EoWHK7VrzBnpeO98J1d/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Jesus, these eyes have never seen, 
    That radiant form of Thine; 
    The veil of sense hangs dark between 
    Thy bless'd face and mine. 

    2.
    I see Thee not, I hear Thee not, 
    Yet art Thou oft with me; 
    And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot, 
    As where I meet with Thee. 

    3.
    Like some bright dream that comes unsought, 
    When slumbers o'er me roll, 
    Thine image ever fills my thought, 
    And charms my ravished soul. 

    4.
    Yet though I have not seen, and still 
    Must rest in faith alone, 
    I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will, 
    Unseen, but not unknown.
