    1.
    Thou hidden source of calm repose, 
    Thou all-sufficient love divine; 
    My help and refuge from my foes, 
    Secure I am if thou art mine, 
    From sin and grief, from guilt and shame; 
    I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name. 

    2.
    Thy mighty name salvation is, 
    And keeps my happy soul above; 
    Comfort it brings, and power and peace, 
    And joy and everlasting love; 
    To me with Thy dear name, are given 
    Pardon and holiness and heaven. 

    3.
    Jesus, my all in all Thou art, 
    My rest in toil, my ease in pain; 
    The medicine of my broken heart; 
    In war, my peace; in loss, my gain; 
    My smile beneath the tyrant's frown; 
    In shame, my glory and my crown. 

    4.
    In want, my plentiful supply; 
    In weakness, my almighty power; 
    In bonds, my perfect liberty; 
    My light in Satan's darkest hour; 
    In grief, my joy unspeakable; 
    My life in death; my heaven, my all.
