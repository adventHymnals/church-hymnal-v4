    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
    That was slain.
    CHORUS:
    Glory, hallelujah!
    Praise Him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah!
    To the Lamb!

    Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
    Now the power of sin consume;
    Bring Thy blessed millennium,
    Holy Lamb.

    Thus may we each moment feel,
    Love Him, serve Him, praise Him still,
    Till we all on Zion's hill
    See the Lamb.
