    1.
    O Saviour, precious Saviour, 
    Whom, yet unseen, we love, 
    O Name of might and favor, 
    All other names above! 
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
    To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
    Our holy Lord and King. 

    2.
    O bringer of salvation, 
    Who wondrously hast wrought, 
    Thyself the revelation 
    Of love beyond out thought, 
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
    To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
    Our gracious Lord and King. 

    3.
    In Thee all fulness dwelleth, 
    All grace and power divine; 
    The glory that excelleth, 
    O Son of God, is Thine; 
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
    To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
    Our glorious Lord and King. 

    4.
    O grant the consummation 
    Of this our song above, 
    In endless adoration, 
    And everlasting love; 
    Then shall we praise and bless Thee 
    Where perfect praises ring, 
    And evermore confess Thee 
    Our Saviour and our King.
