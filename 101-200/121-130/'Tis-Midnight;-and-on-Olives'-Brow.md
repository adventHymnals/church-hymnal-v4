    1.
    'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow 
    The star is dimmed that lately shone: 
    'Tis midnight; in the garden, now, 
    The suffering Savior prays alone. 

    2.
    'Tis midnight; and from all removed, 
    The Saviour wrestles lone with fears; 
    E'en that disciple whom He loved 
    Heeds not His Master's grief and tears. 

    3.
    'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt 
    The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood; 
    Yet He who hath in anguish knelt, 
    Is not forsaken by His God. 

    4.
    'Tis midnight; and from ether plains 
    Is borne the song that angels know; 
    Unheard by mortals are the strains 
    That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.
