    1.
    Jesus, Thy boundless love to me 
    No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
    O knit my thankful heart to Thee, 
    And reign without a rival there; 
    Thine wholly, Thine alone I am; 
    Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame. 

    2.
    O, grant that nothing in my soul 
    May dwell but Thy pure love alone; 
    Oh, may Thy love possess me whole, 
    My joy, my treasure, and my crown; 
    All coldness from my heart remove; 
    My every act, word, thought, be love. 

    3.
    O love, how cheering is thy ray! 
    All pain before thy presence flies; 
    Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away 
    Wherev'er Thy healing beams arise; 
    O Jesus, nothing may I see' 
    Nothing desire or seek, but Thee. 

    4.
    In suffering be Thy love my peace, 
    In weakness be Thy love my power; 
    And when the storms of life shall cease, 
    Jesus, in that important hour, 
    In death, as life, be Thou my guide, 
    And save me, who for me hast died.
