    1.
    O Gift of God, we praise Thee, 
    That ever Thou didst come 
    To guide our wayward footsteps 
    Back to the Father's home. 

    2.
    O Gift of God, we take Thee 
    To be our All in All; 
    We know Thou art sufficient 
    Whatever may befall. 

    3.
    O Gift of God, we give Thee 
    Ourselves, Thine own to be; 
    Accept us, save and keep us 
    Throughout eternity.
