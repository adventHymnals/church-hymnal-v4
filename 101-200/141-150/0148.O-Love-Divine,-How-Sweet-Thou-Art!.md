    1.
    O love divine, how sweet thou art! 
    When shall I find my willing heart 
    All taken up by thee? 
    I thirst, I faint, I die to prove 
    The greatness of redeeming love, 
    The love of Christ to me. 

    2.
    Stronger His love than death or hell; 
    Its riches are unsearchable; 
    The first born sons of light 
    Desire in vain its depths to see; 
    They cannot reach the mystery, 
    The length, and breadth, and height. 

    3.
    God only knows the love of God; 
    O that it now were shed abroad 
    In this poor stony heart! 
    For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
    This only portion, Lord, be mine' 
    Be mine this better part! 

    4.
    O that I could forever sit 
    With Mary at the Master's feet! 
    Be this my happy choice; 
    My only care, delight, and bliss, 
    My joy, my heaven on earth, be this 
    To hear the Bridegroom's voice.
