    1.
    Jesus, and shall it ever be, 
    A mortal man, ashamed of Thee? 
    Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise, 
    Whose glories shine through endless days? 

    2.
    Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far 
    Let evening blush to own a star; 
    He sheds the beams of light divine 
    O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

    3.
    Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon 
    Let midnight be ashamed of noon; 
    'Twas midnight with my soul, till He 
    Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee. 

    4.
    Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend 
    On Whom my hopes of Heaven depend! 
    No; when I blush, be this my shame, 
    That I no more revere His Name. 

    5.
    Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may 
    When I've no guilt to wash away; 
    No tear to wipe, no good to crave, 
    No fears to quell, no soul to save. 
    Till then'nor is my boasting vain' 
    Till then I boast a Saviour slain: 
    And, O, may this my glory be, 
    That Christ is not ashamed of me!
