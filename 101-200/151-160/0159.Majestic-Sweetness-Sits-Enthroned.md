    1.
    Majestic sweetness sits enthroned 
    Upon the Saviour's brow; 
    His head with radiant light is crowned, 
    His lips with grace o'erflow, 
    His lips with grace o'erflow. 

    2.
    No mortal can with Him compare, 
    Among the sons of men; 
    Fairer is He than all the fair 
    That fill the heav'nly train, 
    That fill the heav'nly train. 

    3.
    He saw me plunged in deep distress, 
    And flew to my relief; 
    For me He bore the shameful cross, 
    And carried all my grief, 
    And carried all my grief. 

    4.
    To Him I owe my life and breath, 
    And all the joys I have; 
    He makes me triumph over death, 
    He saves me from the grave, 
    He saves me from the grave. 

    5.
    To Heaven, the place of His abode, 
    He brings my weary feet; 
    Shows me the glories of my God, 
    And makes my joys complete, 
    And makes my joys complete. 

    6.
    Since from His bounty I receive 
    Such proofs of love divine, 
    Had I a thousand hearts to give, 
    Lord, they should all be Thine, 
    Lord, they should all be Thine.
