    1.
    Our Lord is risen from the dead; 
    Our Jesus is gone up on high! 
    A captive host He joyful led, 
    To the bright portals of the sky. 

    2.
    There His triumphal chariot waits, 
    And angels chant the solemn lay: 
    "Lift up your heads, ye heavenly gates; 
    Ye everlasting doors, give way." 

    3.
    Loose all your bars of golden light, 
    And wide unfold the beauteous scene; 
    He claims these mansions as His right, 
    Receive the King of glory in. 

    4.
    Who is this King of glory? Who? 
    The Lord, that all our foes o'ercame; 
    The world, sin, death, and hell o'erthrew; 
    And Jesus is the conqueror's name. 

    5.
    Who is this King of Glory, Who? 
    The Lord, of glorious power possessed; 
    The King of saints and angels, too; 
    God over all, forever blest.
