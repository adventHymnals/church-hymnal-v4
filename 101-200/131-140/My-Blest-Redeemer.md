[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17TA_HJGQeq51CVB0daYVAEOOD1VKp9mR/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    My blest Redeemer and my Lord, 
    I read my duty in Thy Word; 
    But in Thy life the law appears, 
    Drawn out in living characters. 

    2.
    What truth and love Thy bosom fill! 
    What zeal to do Thy Father's Will! 
    Such zeal, and truth, and love divine, 
    I would transcribe, and make them mine. 

    3.
    Cold mountains and the midnight air 
    Witnessed the fervor of Thy prayer; 
    The desert Thy temptations knew, 
    Thy conflict and Thy victory, too. 

    4.
    Be Thou my pattern; make me bear 
    More of Thy gracious image here; 
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name, 
    Among the followers of the Lamb.
