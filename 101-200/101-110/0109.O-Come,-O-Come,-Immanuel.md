    1.
    O come, O come, Emmanuel,
    And ransom captive Israel,
    That mourns in lonely exile here
    Until the Son of God appear.
    Refrain:
    Rejoice! Rejoice!
    Emmanuel shall come to thee,
    O Israel.

    2.
    O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
    And order all things far and night;
    To us the path of knowledge show,
    And cause us in her ways to go.

    3.
    O come, Desire of nations, bind
    All peoples in one heart and mind;
    Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease;
    Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.
