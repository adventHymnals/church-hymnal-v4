    1.
    While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
    All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
    And glory shone around.

    2.
    "Fear nor!" said he- for mighty dread
    Had seized their troubled mind-
    'Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
    To you and all mankind.

    3.
    To you, in David's town this day,
    Is born of David's line,
    The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
    And this shall be the sign:

    4.
    "The heavenly Babe you there shall find
    To human view displayed,
    All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
    And in a manger laid."

    5.
    Thus spake the seraph; and forth with
    Appeared a shining throng
    Of angels praising God on high,
    Who thus addressed their song:

    6.
    "All glory be to God on high,
    And to the earth be peace;
    Good will henceforth from heaven to men,
    Begin and never cease!"
