    1.
    All my heart this night rejoices, 
    As I hear, 
    Far and near, 
    Sweetest angel voices; 
    "Christ is born," their choirs are singing, 
    Till the air, 
    Everywhere, 
    Now with joy is ringing. 

    2.
    Hark! a voice from yonder manger, 
    Soft and sweet, 
    Doth entreat: 
    "Flee from woe and danger; 
    Brethren, come; from all that grieves you, 
    You are freed; 
    All you need 
    I will surely give you." 

    3.
    Come, then, let us hasten yonder; 
    Here let all, 
    Great and small, 
    Kneel in awe and wonder; 
    Love Him who with love is yearning; 
    Hail the star, 
    That from far 
    Bright with hope is burning!
