    1.
    In the sun, and moon, and stars, 
    Signs and wonders have appeared; 
    Earth has groaned with bloody wars, 
    And the hearts of men have feared. 

    2.
    Soon shall ocean's hoary deep, 
    Tossed with stronger tempests, rise; 
    Darker storms the mountain sweep, 
    Fiercer lightning rend the skies. 

    3.
    Dread alarms shall shake the proud, 
    Pale amazement, restless fear; 
    And, amid the thunder-cloud, 
    Shall the Judge of men appear. 

    4.
    But, though from His awful face, 
    Heaven shall fade, and earth shall fly, 
    Fear not, ye, His chosen race, 
    Your redemption draweth nigh.
