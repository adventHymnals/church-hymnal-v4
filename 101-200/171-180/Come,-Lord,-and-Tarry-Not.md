    1.
    Come, Lord, and tarry not; 
    Bring the longlookedfor day; 
    O why these years of waiting here? 
    O why this long delay? 

    2.
    Come, for creation groans, 
    Impatient of Thy stay; 
    Worn out by these long years of ill, 
    These ages of delay. 

    3.
    Come, for the corn is ripe! 
    Put in Thy sickle now; 
    Reap the great harvest of the earth; 
    Sower and reaper Thou. 

    4.
    Come, spoil the strong man's house, 
    Bind him and cast him hence; 
    Show Thyself stronger than the strong, 
    Thyself Omnipotence. 

    5.
    Come, and begin Thy reign 
    Of everlasting peace; 
    Come, take the kingdom to Thyself, 
    Great King of righteousness.
