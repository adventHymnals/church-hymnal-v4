    1.
    Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes, 
    And raise your voices high; 
    Awake, and praise that sovereign love, 
    That shows salvation nigh; 
    Awake, and praise that sovereign love, 
    That shows salvation nigh. 

    2.
    Swift on the wings of time it flies; 
    Each moment brings it near; 
    Then welcome each declining day, 
    Welcome each closing year; 
    Then welcome each declining day, 
    Welcome each closing year. 

    3.
    Not many years their round shall run, 
    Not many mornings rise, 
    Ere all its glories stand revealed 
    To our admiring eyes; 
    Ere all its glories stand revealed 
    To our admiring eyes. 

    4.
    Ye wheels of nature, speed your course! 
    Ye mortal powers, decay! 
    Haste! till the last glad morning rise 
    That brings eternal day; 
    Haste! till the last glad morning rise 
    That brings eternal day.
