    1.
    Come, sound His praise abroad, 
    And hymns of glory sing; 
    Jehovah is the sovereign God, 
    The universal King. 

    2.
    He formed the deeps unknown; 
    He gave the seas their bound; 
    The watery worlds are all His own, 
    And His the solid ground. 

    3.
    Come, worship at His throne, 
    Come, bow before the Lord; 
    We are His works, and not our own; 
    He formed us by His word. 

    4.
    Today attend His voice, 
    Nor dare provoke His rod; 
    Come, like the people of His choice, 
    And own your gracious God.
