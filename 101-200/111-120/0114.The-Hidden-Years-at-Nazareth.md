    1.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How Beautiful they seem, 
    Like fountains flowing in the dark 
    Or waters in a dream ! 
    Like waters under Syrian stars 
    Reflecting lights above, 
    Repeating in their silent depths 
    The wonder of God's love. 

    2.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How marvelous they lie, 
    As open to the smile of God 
    As to the Syrians sky ! 
    As open to the heart of man 
    As to the genial sun, 
    With dreams of high asventuring, 
    And deeds of kindness done. 

    3.
    The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
    How radiant they rise 
    With life and death in balance laid 
    Before a lad's clear eyes ! 
    O soul of youth, forever choose, 
    Forgetting fate or fear, 
    To live for truth, or die with God, 
    Who stands beside thee here.
