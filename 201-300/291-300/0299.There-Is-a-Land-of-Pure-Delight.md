    1.
    There is a land of pure delight, 
    Where saints immortal reign, 
    Infinite day excludes the night, 
    And pleasures banish pain. 
    There everlasting spring abides, 
    And never withering flowers, 
    And but a little space divides 
    This heav'nly land from ours. 

    2.
    O could we make our doubts remove, 
    Those gloomy thoughts that rise, 
    And see the Canaan that we love, 
    With unbeclouded eyes; 
    Could we but climb where Moses stood, 
    And view the landscape o'er, 
    Not all this world's pretended good 
    Could ever charm us more.
