[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utHNz09rcvk9wsIUQ9f6v4wKpVj0Q3nI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark, my soul! it is the Lord; 
    'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word; 
    Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee, 
    "Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

    2.
    "Mine is an unchanging love, 
    Higher than the heights above; 
    Deeper than the depths beneath, 
    Free and faithful, strong as death." 

    3.
    "Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
    When the work of grace is done; 
    Partner of My throne shalt be! 
    Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

    4.
    Lord, it is my chief complaint 
    That my love is weak and faint; 
    Yet I love Thee and adore; 
    O for grace to love more!
