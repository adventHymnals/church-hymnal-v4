    1.
    Awake! Jerusalem, awake! 
    No longer in thy sins lie down; 
    The garment of salvation take, 
    Thy beauty and thy strength put on. 

    2.
    Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight, 
    And hides the promise from thine eyes: 
    Arise, and struggle into light; 
    The great Deliverer calls, Arise! 

    3.
    Shake off the bands of sad despair; 
    Zion, assert thy liberty; 
    Look up, thy broken heart prepare, 
    And God shall set the captive free. 

    4.
    Vessels of mercy, sons of grace, 
    Be purged from every sinful slain; 
    Be like your Lord, His word embrace, 
    Nor bear His hallowed name in vain.
