    1.
    O how happy are they 
    Who their Saviour obey, 
    And have laid up their treasure above! 
    Tongue can never express 
    The sweet comfort and peace 
    Of a soul in its earliest love. 

    2.
    That sweet comfort is mine, 
    Since the favor divine 
    I received through the blood of the Lamb; 
    Since my heart first believed. 
    What a joy I've received, 
    What a heaven in Jesus' dear name! 

    3.
    'Tis a heaven below 
    My Redeemer to know; 
    And the angels can do nothing more 
    Than to fall at His feet, 
    And the story repeat, 
    And the Lover of sinners adore. 

    4.
    Jesus all the day long 
    Is my joy and my song; 
    O that all to this refuge might fly! 
    He hath loved me, indeed, 
    He did suffer and bleed, 
    To redeem such a rebel as I. 

    5.
    On the wings of His love, 
    I am carried above 
    All my sin, and temptation, and pain; 
    O, that all would believe, 
    And by sin never grieve, 
    And thus cause Him to suffer again.
