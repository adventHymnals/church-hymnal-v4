    1.
    Holy Bible! Book divine! 
    Precious treasure, thou art mine! 
    Mine to tell me whence I came; 
    Mine to teach me what I am. 

    2.
    Mine to chide me when I rove; 
    Mine to show a Savior's love; 
    Mine to guide my wayward feet; 
    Mine to judge, condemn, acquit. 

    3.
    Mine to comfort in distress; 
    If the Holy Spirit bless; 
    Mine to show by living faith, 
    Man can triumph over death. 

    4.
    Mine to tell of joys to come, 
    In the saint's eternal home: 
    O thou holy Book divine, 
    Precious treasure, thou art mine! 
    I win the strife.
