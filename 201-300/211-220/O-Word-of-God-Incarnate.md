    1.
    O Word of God incarnate, 
    O Wisdom from on high, 
    O Truth unchanged, unchanging, 
    O Light of our dark sky: 
    We praise thee for the radiance 
    That from the hallowed page, 
    A lantern to our footsteps, 
    Shines on from age to age. 

    2.
    The church from her dear Master 
    Received the gift divine, 
    And still that light is lifted 
    O'er all the earth to shine. 
    It is the golden casket, 
    Where gems of truth are stored; 
    It is the heaven-drawn picture 
    Of Christ, the living Word. 

    3.
    It floateth like a banner 
    Before God's host unfurled; 
    It shines like a beacon 
    Above the darkling world. 
    It is the chart and compass 
    That o'er life's surging sea, 
    'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands, 
    Still guides, O Christ, to Thee. 

    4.
    O make thy church, dear Saviour, 
    A lamp of purest gold, 
    To bear before the nations 
    Thy true light as of old. 
    O teach thy wandering pilgrims 
    By this their path to trace, 
    Till, clouds and darkness ended, 
    They see thee face to face.
