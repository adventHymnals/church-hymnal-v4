    1.
    Holy Spirit, lamp of light, 
    Shine upon our nature's night; 
    Give thy blessed inward sight, 
    Comforter divine! 

    2.
    We are sinful; cleanse us, Lord; 
    We are faint; thy strength afford; 
    Lost' until by thee restored, 
    Comforter divine! 

    3.
    Like the dew, thy peace distill; 
    Guide, subdue our wayward will, 
    Things of Christ unfolding still, 
    Comforter divine! 

    4.
    In us "Abba, Father," cry' 
    Earnest of our rest on high, 
    Hope of immortality, 
    Comforter divine! 

    5.
    Search for us the depths of God; 
    Bear us up the starry road 
    To the height of thine abode, 
    Comforter divine!
