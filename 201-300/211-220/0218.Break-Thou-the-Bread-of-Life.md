    1.
    Break thou the bread of life, 
    Dear Lord, to me, 
    As thou didst break the loaves 
    Beside the sea; 
    Beyond the sacred page 
    I seek thee, Lord; 
    My spirit pants for thee, 
    O living Word! 

    2.
    Bless thou the truth revealed 
    This day to me, 
    As thou didst bless the bread 
    By Galilee; 
    Then shall all bondage cease, 
    All fetters fall; 
    And I shall find in thee, 
    My all in all! 

    3.
    Spirit and life are they, 
    Words thou dost speak; 
    I hasten to obey, 
    But I am weak; 
    Thou art my only help, 
    Thou art my life; 
    Heeding thy holy word 
    I win the strife.
