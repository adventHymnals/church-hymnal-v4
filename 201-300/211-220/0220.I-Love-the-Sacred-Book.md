[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPxctTAwjljA_PJOH8qUoX5QVcWnxb7z/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I love the sacred book of God, 
    No other can its place supply; 
    It points me to the saints' abode, 
    And bids me from destruction fly. 

    2.
    Sweet book! in thee my eyes discern 
    The image of my absent Lord; 
    From thy instructive page I learn 
    The joys His presence will afford. 

    3.
    But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 
    His place, and tell me of His love; 
    I'll read with faith's discerning eye, 
    And thus partake of joys above. 

    4.
    Within thy sacred lids is found 
    A transcript of my Maker's will; 
    Treasures of knowledge here abound, 
    The deepest, loftiest mind to fill. 

    5.
    Light of the world, thy beams impart, 
    To lead my feet through life's dark way; 
    O, shine on this benighted heart, 
    Nor let me from thy guidance stray.
