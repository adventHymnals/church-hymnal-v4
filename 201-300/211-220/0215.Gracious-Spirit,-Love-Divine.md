    1.
    Gracious Spirit, Love divine, 
    Let thy light within me shine, 
    All my guilty fears remove, 
    Fill me with thy heavenly love. 

    2.
    Speak thy pardoning grace to me, 
    Set the burdened sinner free, 
    Lead me to the Lamb of God, 
    Wash me in his precious blood. 

    3.
    Life and peace to me impart, 
    Seal salvation on my heart, 
    Breathe thyself into my breast, 
    Earnest of immortal rest. 

    4.
    Let me never from thee stray, 
    Keep me in the narrow way, 
    Fill my soul with joy divine, 
    Keep me, Lord, forever thine.
