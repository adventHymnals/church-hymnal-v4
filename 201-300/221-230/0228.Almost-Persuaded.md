    1.
    Almost persuaded now to believe; 
    Almost persuaded Christ to receive. 
    Seems now some soul to say, 
    'Go, Spirit, go thy way, 
    Some more convenient day 
    On thee I'll call.' 

    2.
    Almost persuaded, come, come today; 
    Almost persuaded, turn not away. 
    Jesus invites you here, 
    Angels are lingering near, 
    Prayers rise from hearts so dear; 
    O wanderer, come! 

    3.
    Almost persuaded, harvest is past; 
    Almost persuaded, doom comes at last! 
    'Almost' cannot avail; 
    'Almost' is but to fail! 
    Sad, sad that bitter wail, 
    'Almost'but lost!'
