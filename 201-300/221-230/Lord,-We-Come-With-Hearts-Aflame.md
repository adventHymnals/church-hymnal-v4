    1.
    Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
    Seeking service in thy name; 
    All our youth and strength are thine, 
    Given to help thy work divine; 
    All our love and faith we bring, 
    They are thine, O heavenly King. 

    2.
    Lord of hosts, we ask thine aid, 
    Keep us ever unafraid; 
    Hold us loyal, hold us true 
    To the task we have to do; 
    Lead us on to victory, 
    We shall triumph praising thee. 

    3.
    Lord of all, we take our stand, 
    Giving help at thy command; 
    Eager, joyful, blithe, and strong, 
    Thrilled with love and filled with song; 
    Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
    Seeking service in thy name.
