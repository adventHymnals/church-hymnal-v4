    1.
    Return, O wanderer, return, 
    And seek thy Father's face; 
    Those new desires which in thee burn, 
    Were kindled by His grace. 

    2.
    Return, O wanderer, return; 
    He hears thy humble sigh; 
    He sees thy softened spirit mourn, 
    When no one else is nigh. 

    3.
    Return, O wanderer, return; 
    Thy Saviour bids thee live; 
    Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn 
    How freely He'll forgive. 

    4.
    Return, O wanderer, return; 
    And wipe the falling tear; 
    Thy Father calls-no longer mourn; 
    'Tis love invites thee near. 

    5.
    Return, O wanderer, return; 
    Regain thy long, sought rest; 
    The Saviour's melting mercies yearn 
    To clasp thee to his breast.
