    1.
    Behold the Saviour at the door! 
    He gently knocks, has knocked before, 
    Has waited long, is waiting still; 
    You treat no other friend so ill. 

    2.
    He counsels thee to buy of him 
    Gold tried by fire, and raiment clean; 
    Anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see, 
    And put away thy stains from thee. 

    3.
    O, hear the faithful Witness' voice, 
    He offers now a final choice; 
    Thou art offensive, O lukewarm! 
    Therefore be zealous and reform. 

    4.
    His mission now is almost o'er, 
    Before the throne He'll plead no more; 
    The filthy must his filth retain, 
    He that is holy, so remain. 

    5.
    His locks with dews of night are wet, 
    But at thy heart he lingereth yet. 
    O wake, and open wide the door; 
    Bid thy Beloved wait no more. 

    6.
    Yea, bring him in, a welcome guest; 
    So shalt thou in his presence rest, 
    And in communion sweet and free, 
    Shalt sup with him and he with thee.
