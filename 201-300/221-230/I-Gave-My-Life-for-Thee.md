    1.
    I gave my life for thee, 
    My precious blood I shed, 
    That thou might'st ransom be, 
    And quickened from the dead; 
    I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
    What hast thou given for me? 
    I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
    What hast thou given for me? 

    2.
    My Fathers house of light, 
    My glory circled throne, 
    I left for earthly night, 
    For wanderings sad and lone; 
    I left, I left it all for thee, 
    Hast thou left aught for me? 
    I left, I left it all for thee, 
    Hast thou left aught for me? 

    3.
    I suffered much for thee, 
    More than thy tongue can tell, 
    Of bitterest agony, 
    To rescue thee from hell; 
    I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
    What hast thou borne for me? 
    I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
    What hast thou borne for me?
