    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, come, 
    Let thy bright beams arise, 
    Dispel the sorrow from our minds, 
    The darkness from our eyes. 

    2.
    Convince us all of sin, 
    Then lead to Jesus' blood, 
    And to our wondering view reveal 
    The mercies of our God. 

    3.
    Revive our drooping faith, 
    Our doubts and fears remove, 
    And kindle in our breasts the flame 
    Of never dying love. 

    4.
    'Tis Thine to cleanse the heart, 
    To sanctify the soul, 
    To pour fresh life in every part, 
    And new create the whole. 

    5.
    Come, Holy Spirit, come, 
    Our minds from bondage free; 
    Then we shall know, and praise, and love, 
    The Father, Son, and Thee.
