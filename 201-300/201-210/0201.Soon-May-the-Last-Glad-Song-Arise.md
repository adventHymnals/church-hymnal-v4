    1.
    Soon may the last glad song arise 
    Through all the millions of the skies; 
    That song of triumph which records 
    That all the earth is now the Lord's. 

    2.
    Let thrones and powers and kingdoms be 
    Obedient, mighty God, to Thee; 
    And over land and stream and main 
    Wave Thou the scepter of Thy reign. 

    3.
    O let the anthem now might swell, 
    And host to host the triumph tell, 
    Till not one rebel heart remains, 
    But over all the Savior reigns!
