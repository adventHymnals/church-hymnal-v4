    1.
    Lord, I hear of showers of blessing, 
    Thou art scattering full and free; 
    Showers, the thirsty soul refreshing; 
    Let some drops now fall on me, 
    Even me, even me, 
    Let some drops now fall on me. 

    2.
    Pass me not, O gracious Father! 
    Sinful though my heart may be; 
    Thou might'st leave me, but the rather 
    Let thy mercy rest on me. 
    Even me, even me, 
    Let some drops now fall on me. 

    3.
    Have I long in sin been sleeping? 
    Long been slighting, grieving, thee? 
    Has the world my heart been keeping? 
    O forgive and rescue me! 
    Even me, even me, 
    Let some drops now fall on me. 

    4.
    Pass me not, O Holy Spirit! 
    Thou canst make the blind to see; 
    Testify of Jesus' merit, 
    Speak the word of peace to me. 
    Even me, even me, 
    Let some drops now fall on me.
