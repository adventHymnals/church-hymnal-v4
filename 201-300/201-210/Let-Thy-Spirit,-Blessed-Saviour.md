[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uT%2DPJjmvlO5Bo_DgVGEl3WoFxD8RXnYR/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour, 
    Come and bid our doubtings cease; 
    Come, O, come with love and favor, 
    Fill us all with joy and peace. 

    2.
    Fearful dangers are around us, 
    Satan watches to destroy; 
    Lord, our foes would fain confound us; 
    O, for us thy might employ! 

    3.
    On thy word our souls are resting; 
    Taught by thee, thy name we love; 
    Sweetest of all names is Jesus; 
    How it doth our spirits move! 

    4.
    Let us not, O Lord, be weary 
    Of the roughness of the way; 
    Though the road be often dreary, 
    Thou shalt drive our gloom away.
