    1.
    Come, gracious Spirit, heav'nly Dove, 
    With light and comfort from above; 
    Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our Guide; 
    O'er all thoughts and step preside. 

    2.
    To us the light of truth display, 
    And make us know and choose thy way; 
    Plant holy fear in every heart, 
    That we from God may ne'er depart. 

    3.
    Lead us to holiness'the road 
    That we must take to dwell with God; 
    Lead us to Christ, the living way, 
    Nor let us from his precepts stray. 

    4.
    Lead us to God, our final rest, 
    To be with him forever blest; 
    Lead us to heaven, its bliss to share 
    Fullness of joy forever there!
