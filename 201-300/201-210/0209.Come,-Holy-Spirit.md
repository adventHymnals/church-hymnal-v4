    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 
    With all thy quickening powers; 
    Kindle a flame of sacred love 
    In these cold hearts of ours. 

    2.
    O raise our thoughts from things below, 
    From vanities and toys! 
    Then shall we with fresh courage go 
    To reach eternal joys. 

    3.
    Awake our souls to joyful songs; 
    Let pure devotion rise; 
    Till praise employs our thankful tongues, 
    And doubt forever dies. 

    4.
    Father, we would no longer live 
    At this poor, dying rate; 
    To thee our tankful love we give, 
    For thine to us is great. 

    5.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 
    With all thy quickening powers; 
    Come, shed abroad the Saviour's love 
    And that shall kindle ours.
