    1.
    We stand in deep repentance, 
    Before thy throne of love; 
    O God of grace, forgive us, 
    The stain of guilt remove. 

    2.
    Behold us while with weeping 
    We lift our eyes to thee; 
    And, all our sins subduing, 
    Our Father, set us free! 

    3.
    O, shouldst thou from the fallen 
    Withhold thy grace to guide, 
    Forever we should wander, 
    From thee, and peace, aside. 

    4.
    Our souls'on thee we cast them, 
    Our only refuge thou! 
    Thy cheering words revive us, 
    When pressed with grief we bow. 

    5.
    Thou bearest the trusting spirit 
    Upon thy loving breast, 
    And givest all thy ransomed 
    A sweet, unending rest.
