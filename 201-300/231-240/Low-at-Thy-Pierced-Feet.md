[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rzRINFxTc6OxatPWzsEpklaRNOeyl8C_/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Low at thy pierced feet, 
    Saviour of all, 
    Helpless and sorrowful 
    Prostrate I fall. 
    O cast me not away, 
    Forgive my sin this day, 
    Forgive my sin, 
    All, all my sin. 

    2.
    Sinful my life hath been, 
    Unclean, unclean; 
    All my iniquity 
    Thine eye hath seen; 
    Cleanse thou my soul today, 
    Wash all my sin away 
    In thine own blood, 
    In thine own blood. 

    3.
    By all thy grief and pain, 
    Forgive me now; 
    Before thy cross in shame 
    Lowly I bow. 
    Lord, let that blood of thine 
    Wash now this soul of mine; 
    Wash now this soul, 
    Wash now this soul. 

    4.
    Thou didst for me endure 
    Dread Calvary; 
    Sin's punishment and shame 
    All, all for me. 
    On thee my guilt was laid, 
    By thee my dept was paid, 
    To set me free, 
    To set me free. 

    5.
    Lord, I accept thee now, 
    Accept thou me; 
    I have delayed too long, 
    And grieved thee. 
    By all thy love to me, 
    I give myself to thee; 
    Make me thine own, 
    All, all thine own.
