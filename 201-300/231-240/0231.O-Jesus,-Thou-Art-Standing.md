    1.
    O Jesus, thou art standing, 
    Outside the fast-closed door, 
    In lowly patience waiting 
    To pass the threshold o'er: 
    Shame on us, Christian brethren, 
    His Name and sign who bear, 
    O shame, thrice shame upon us, 
    To keep him standing there! 

    2.
    O Jesus, thou art knocking; 
    And lo, that hand is scarred, 
    And thorns thy brow encircle, 
    And tears thy face have marred. 
    O love that passeth knowledge, 
    So patiently to wait! 
    O sin that hath no equal, 
    So fast to bar the gate! 

    3.
    O Jesus, thou art pleading 
    In accents meek and low, 
    "I died for you, my children, 
    And will you treat me so?" 
    O Lord, with shame and sorrow 
    We open now the door; 
    Dear Saviour, enter, enter, 
    And leave us never more.
