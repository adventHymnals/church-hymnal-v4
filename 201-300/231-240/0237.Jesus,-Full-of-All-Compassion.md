    1.
    Jesus, full of all compassion, 
    Hear thy humble suppliant's cry; 
    Let me know thy great salvation; 
    See, I languish, faint and die. 
    Guilty, but with heart relenting, 
    Overwhelmed with helpless grief, 
    Prostrate at Thy feet repining, 
    Send, O send me quick relief. 

    2.
    Whither should my soul be flying, 
    But to him who comfort gives? 
    Whither, from the dread of dying, 
    But to him who ever lives? 
    While I view thee, wounded, grieving, 
    Breathless, on the cursed tree, 
    Fain I'd feel my heart believing 
    Thou didst suffer thus for me. 

    3.
    With thy righteousness and Spirit, 
    I am more than angels blessed; 
    Heir with thee, all things inherit' 
    Peace, and joy, and endless rest. 
    Saved! the deed shall spread new glory 
    Through the shining realms above; 
    Angels sing the pleasing story, 
    All enraptured with thy love.
