[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkVkmxmzhDf2hbgvSHfXfI-bh5pDRvNC/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Depth of mercy!'can there be 
    Mercy still reserved for me? 
    Can my God his wrath forbear? 
    Me, the chief of sinners, spare? 

    2.
    I have long withstood his grace, 
    Long provoked him to his face, 
    Would not hearken to his calls, 
    Grieved him by a thousand falls. 

    3.
    Now incline me to repent; 
    Let me now my sins lament; 
    Now my foul revolt deplore, 
    Weep, believe, and sin no more. 

    4.
    There for me the Saviour stands, 
    Shows his wounds and spreads his hands; 
    God is love! I know, I feel; 
    Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
