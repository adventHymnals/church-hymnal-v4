    1.
    Jesus, to thee I now can fly, 
    On whom my help is laid; 
    Oppressed by sins, I lift my eye, 
    And see the shadows fade. 

    2.
    Believing on my Lord, I find 
    A sure and present aid; 
    On thee alone my constant mind 
    Be every moment stayed. 

    3.
    Whate'er in me seems wise, or good, 
    Or strong, I here disclaim; 
    I wash my garments in the blood 
    Of the atoning Lamb. 

    4.
    Jesus, my Strength, my Life, my Rest, 
    On thee will I depend, 
    Till summoned to the marriage-feast, 
    When faith in sight shall end.
