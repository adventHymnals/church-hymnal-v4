    1.
    Lord! at thy feet we humbly lie, 
    And knock at mercy's door; 
    With heavy heart and downcast eye 
    Thy favor we implore. 

    2.
    'Tis mercy, we implore; 
    We would thy pity move; 
    Thy grace is an exhaustless store, 
    And thou thyself art love. 

    3.
    O, for thine own, for Jesus' sake, 
    Our numerous sins forgive! 
    Thy grace our stony hearts can break; 
    Heal us, and bid us live.
