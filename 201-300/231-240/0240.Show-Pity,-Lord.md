[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJ3jsGRT0ysn70FyCC1RQJk5AeBmtj7N/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive! 
    Let a repenting sinner live; 
    Are not thy mercies large and free? 
    May not the guilty trust in thee? 

    2.
    My crimes, though great, do not surpass 
    The power and glory of thy grace; 
    O, wash my soul from every sin, 
    And make my guilty conscience clean! 

    3.
    My lips with shame my sins confess, 
    Against thy law, against thy grace; 
    Lord, should thy judgment be severe, 
    I am condemned, but thou art clear. 

    4.
    Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, 
    Whose hope, still hovering'round thy Word, 
    Would light on some sweet promise there, 
    Some sure support against despair.
