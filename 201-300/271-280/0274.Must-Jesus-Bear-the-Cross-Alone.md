    Major Key: G

    1.
    Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 
    And all the world go free? 
    No, there's a cross for everyone,
    And there's a cross for me.

    2.
    The consecrated cross I'll bear
    Till He shall set me free; 
    And then go home my crown to wear, 
    For there's a crown for me.

    3.
    Upon the crystal pavement, down 
    At Jesus' pierced feet,
    With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
    And His dear name repeat.
