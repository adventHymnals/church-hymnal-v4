    1.
    My Jesus, I love thee, I know Thou art mine; 
    For Thee all the follies of sin I resign. 
    My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou; 
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    2.
    I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me, 
    And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
    I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow; 
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    3.
    I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
    And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
    And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
    If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    4.
    In mansions of glory and endless delight; 
    I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
    I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
    If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
