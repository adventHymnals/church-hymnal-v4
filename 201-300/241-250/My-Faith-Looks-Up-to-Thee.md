    1.
    My faith looks up to Thee,
    Thou Lamb of Calvary,
    Savior divine;
    Now hear me while I pray,
    Take all my guilt away,
    O let me from this day
    Be wholly Thine.

    2.
    May Thy rich grace impart
    Strength to my fainting heart,
    My zeal inspire!
    As Thou hast died for me,
    O may my love to Thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,
    A living fire!

    3.
    While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
    Be Thou my guide;
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
    From Thee aside.
