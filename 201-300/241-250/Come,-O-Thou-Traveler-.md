[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ysrZ89SQdSykNhWBR5broGEID6k1Zv%2Dq/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Come, O thou Traveler unknown, 
    Whom still I hold but cannot see; 
    My company before is gone, 
    And I am left alone with thee; 
    With thee all night I mean to stay, 
    And wrestle till the break of day. 

    2.
    I need not tell thee who I am, 
    My sin and misery declare; 
    Thyself hast called me by my name, 
    Look on thy hands, and read it there; 
    But who, I ask thee, who art thou? 
    Tell me thy name, and tell me now. 

    3.
    In vain thou strugglest to get free; 
    I never will unloose my hold; 
    Art thou the Man that died for me? 
    The secret of thy love unfold; 
    Clinging, I will not let thee go, 
    Till I thy name, thy nature know.
