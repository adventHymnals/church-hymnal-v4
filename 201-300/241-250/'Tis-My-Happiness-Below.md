    1.
    'Tis my happiness below 
    Not to live without the cross; 
    But the Saviour's power to know, 
    Sanctifying every loss. 

    2.
    Trials must and will befall; 
    But with humble faith to see 
    Love inscribed upon them all' 
    This is happiness to me. 

    3.
    Did I meet no trials here, 
    No chastisement by the way, 
    Might I not with reason fear 
    I should prove a castaway? 

    4.
    Trials make the promise sweet; 
    Trials give new life to prayer; 
    Trials bring me to his feet, 
    Lay me low, and keep me there.
