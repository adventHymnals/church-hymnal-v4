[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yp62aAakFBfU9HI9SOmC3Hq_zeMbeYG5/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    When, my Saviour, shall I be 
    Perfectly resigned to Thee? 
    Poor and vile in my own eyes, 
    Only in thy wisdom wise. 

    2.
    Only thee content to know, 
    Ignorant of all below; 
    Only guided by thy light, 
    Only mighty in thy might? 

    3.
    Fully in my life express 
    All the heights of holiness; 
    Sweetly let my spirit prove 
    All the depths of humble love.
