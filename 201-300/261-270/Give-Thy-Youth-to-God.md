[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4X7q22v6QEgl7MQI51ExCEQdk8uMUMg/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Give thou thy youth to God, 
    With all its budding love; 
    Send up the opening heart to him, 
    Fix it on things above. 

    2.
    He seeks thy heart, my child; 
    He wants to make thee blest; 
    Thy soul with his own joy to fill, 
    To give thee peace and rest. 

    3.
    Take thou the side of God, 
    In all things great or small; 
    So shall he ever take thy side, 
    And bear thee safe through all. 
    Guide me in the path to heaven.
