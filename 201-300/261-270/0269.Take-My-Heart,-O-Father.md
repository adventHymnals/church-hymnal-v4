    1.
    Take my heart, O Father, take it! 
    Make and keep it all thine own; 
    Let thy Spirit melt and break it, 
    This proud heart of sin and stone. 

    2.
    Father, make it pure and lowly, 
    Fond of peace and far from strife; 
    Turning from the paths unholy, 
    Of this vain and sinful life. 

    3.
    Ever let thy grace surround me, 
    Strengthen me with power divine; 
    By thy cords of love that bound me, 
    Make me to be wholly thine. 

    4.
    May the blood of Jesus heal me, 
    And my sins be all forgiven; 
    Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 
    Guide me in the path to heaven.
