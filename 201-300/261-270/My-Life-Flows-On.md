    1.
    My life flows on in endless song; 
    Amid earth's lamentation, 
    I hear the sweet, though far-off hymn 
    That hails a new creation; 
    Through all the tumult and the strife 
    I hear the music ringing; 
    It finds an echo in my soul, 
    How can I keep from singing? 

    2.
    What though my joys and comforts die, 
    The Lord my Helper liveth! 
    What though the darkness gather round: 
    Songs in the night He giveth! 
    No storm can shake my inmost calm 
    While to that refuge clinging; 
    Since God is Lord of heaven and earth, 
    How can I keep from singing? 

    3.
    I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin; 
    I see the blue above it; 
    And day by day this pathway smooths 
    Since first I learned to love it. 
    The peace of God makes fresh my heart. 
    A fountain ever spinging; 
    All things are mine, since I am His 
    How can I keep from singing?
