    Major Key: A Flat

    1.
    I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
    Trusting only Thee;
    Trusting Thee for full salvation,
    Great and free.

    2.
    I am trusting Thee for pardon;
    At Thy feet I bow;
    For Thy grace and tender mercy,
    Trusting now.

    3.
    I am trusting Thee to guide me;
    Thou alone shalt lead;
    Every day and hour supplying
    All my need.

    4.
    I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
    Never let me fall;
    I am trusting Thee forever,
    And for all.
