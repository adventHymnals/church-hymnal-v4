[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrmDW6yYE4Z29jNp9AJwl31aosWQk8GE/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    My spirit on thy care, 
    Blest Saviour, I recline; 
    Thou wilt not leave me to despair, 
    For Thou art love divine. 

    2.
    In thee I place my trust, 
    On thee I calmly rest; 
    I know thee good, I know thee just, 
    And count thy choice the best. 

    3.
    Whate'er events betide, 
    Thy will they all perform; 
    Safe in Thy breast my head I hide, 
    Nor fear the coming storm. 

    4.
    Let good or ill befall, 
    It must be good for me, 
    Secure of having Thee in all, 
    Of having all in Thee.
