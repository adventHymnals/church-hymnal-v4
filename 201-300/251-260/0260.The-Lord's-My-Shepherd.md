    The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want
    He makes me down to lie
    In pastures green; He leadeth me
    The quiet waters by.
    He leadeth me, He leadeth me
    The quiet waters by.

    2.
    My soul He doth restore again
    And me to walk doth make
    Within the paths of righteousness
    Even for His own name's sake.
    Within the paths of righteousness
    Even for His own name's sake.

    3.
    Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale
    Yet will I fear no ill
    For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
    And staff me comfort still.
    For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
    And staff me comfort still.

    4.
    My table Thou has furnished
    In presence of my foes;
    My head Thou dost with oil anoint
    And my cup overflows.
    My head Thou dost with oil anoint
    And my cup overflows.

    5.
    Goodness and mercy all my life
    Shall surely follow me,
    And in God's house for evermore
    My dwelling-place shall be.
    And in God's house for evermore
    My dwelling-place shall be.
