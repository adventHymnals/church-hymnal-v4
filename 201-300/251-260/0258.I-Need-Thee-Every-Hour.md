    1.
    I need Thee every hour, Most gracious Lord;
    No tender voice like Thine Can peace afford.
    CHORUS:
    I need Thee, O I need Thee;
    Every hour I need Thee;
    O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

    2.
    I need Thee every hour; Stay Thou nearby;
    Temptations lose their power When Thou art nigh.

    3.
    I need Thee every hour, In joy or pain;
    Come quickly and abide, Or life is vain.

    4.
    I need Thee every hour; Teach me Thy will;
    And Thy rich promises In me fulfill.
