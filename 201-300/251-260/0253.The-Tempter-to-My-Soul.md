[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUzUN4_fWjbdOjywMfP5UoBxz8mQk278/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The tempter to my soul hath said, 
    "There is no help in God for thee;" 
    Lord! lift thou up thy servant's head; 
    My glory, shield, and solace be. 

    2.
    Thus to the Lord I raised my cry; 
    He heard me from his holy hill; 
    At his command the waves rolled by; 
    He beckoned, and the winds were still. 

    3.
    I laid me down and slept, I woke' 
    Thou, Lord, my spirit didst sustain; 
    Bright, from the east, the morning broke; 
    Thy comforts rose on me again. 

    4.
    I will not fear, though armed throngs 
    Compass my steps in all their wrath; 
    Salvation to the Lord belongs; 
    His presence guards His people's path.
