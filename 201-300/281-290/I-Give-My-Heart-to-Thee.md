[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w%2DAgMAYVQ7g4OqlGlrBo%2DPDAyU_UKeJd/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I give my heart to Thee, 
    O Jesus most desired; 
    And heart for heart the gift shall be, 
    For Thou my soul hast fired. 

    2.
    Thou hearts alone wouldst move, 
    Thou only hearts dost love; 
    I would love Thee as Thou lovest me, 
    O Jesus most desired. 

    3.
    What offering can I make, 
    Dear Lord, to love like Thine' 
    That Thou, the Word, didst stoop to take 
    A human form like mine? 

    4.
    Thy heart is opened wide, 
    Its offered love most free, 
    That heart to heart I may abide, 
    And hide myself in Thee. 

    5.
    Ah, how Thy love doth burn, 
    Till I that love return! 
    I would love Thee as Thou lovest me, 
    O Jesus most desired.
