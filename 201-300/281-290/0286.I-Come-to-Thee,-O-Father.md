[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vuEcGHKhyOBSR8gadchmxGKwei5nf4qQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I come to Thee, O Father, 
    Confessing all my sin; 
    I come and claim Thy promise; 
    Come in, dear Lord, come in. 

    2.
    Drive out my sinful nature, 
    Implant Thine own, I pray; 
    And wash and cleanse and save me 
    Each moment, hour and day. 

    3.
    O send Thy Holy Spirit 
    To guide me, I implore; 
    For Jesus' sake, O make me 
    Thy child forevermore.
