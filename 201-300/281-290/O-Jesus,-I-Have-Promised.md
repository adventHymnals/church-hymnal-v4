    1.
    O Jesus, I have promised 
    To serve Thee to the end; 
    Be Thou forever near me, 
    My Master and my Friend. 
    I shall not fear the battle 
    If Thou art by my side, 
    Nor wander from the pathway 
    If Thou wilt be my Guide. 

    2.
    O let me feel Thee near me! 
    The world is ever near; 
    I see the sights that dazzle, 
    The tempting sounds I hear; 
    My foes are ever near me, 
    Around me and within; 
    But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, 
    And shield my soul from sin. 

    3.
    O Jesus, Thou hast promised 
    To all who follow Thee 
    That where Thou art in glory 
    There shall Thy servant be. 
    And Jesus, I have promised 
    To serve Thee to the end; 
    O give me grace to follow, 
    My Master and my Friend.
