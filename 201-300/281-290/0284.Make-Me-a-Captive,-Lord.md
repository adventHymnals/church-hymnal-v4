    1.
    Make me a captive, Lord, And then I shall be free;
    Force me to render up my sword, And I shall conqueror be.
    I sink in life's alarms When by myself I stand;
    Imprison me within Thine arms, And strong shall be my hand.

    2.
    My heart is weak and poor Till it a master find;
    It has no spring of action sure-- It varies with the wind.
    It cannot freely move Till Thou has wrought its chain;
    Enslave it with Thy matchless love, And deathless it shall reign.

    3.
    My will is not my own Till Thou hast made it Thine;
    If it would reach a monarch's throne, It must its crown resign;
    It only stands unbent, Amid the clashing strife,
    When on Thy bosom it has leant, And found in Thee its life.
