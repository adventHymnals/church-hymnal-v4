[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVED6SebM2WPQq89ryLu4nkH0PX1FxlW/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Weary of earth and laden with my sin, 
    I look to heaven and long to enter in; 
    But there no evil thing may find a home, 
    And yet I hear a voice that bids me, "Come." 

    2.
    The while I fain would tread the heavenly way, 
    Evil is ever with me day by day; 
    Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall, 
    "Repent, return; thou shalt be loosed from all." 

    3.
    Cease, restless will! thy lonely strife resign! 
    I know too well how little strength is mine; 
    Grant me, dear Lord, Thy saving love to see; 
    I strive no more; I give myself to Thee.
