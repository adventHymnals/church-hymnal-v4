    1.
    Jesus, where'er Thy people meet, 
    There they behold Thy mercy seat; 
    Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found, 
    And every place is hallowed ground; 

    2.
    For Thou, within no walls confined, 
    Dost dwell with those of humble mind; 
    Such ever bring Thee where they come, 
    And, going, take Thee to their home. 

    3.
    Great Shepherd of Thy chosen few, 
    Thy former mercies now renew; 
    And to our waiting hearts proclaim 
    The sweetness of Thy saving name.
