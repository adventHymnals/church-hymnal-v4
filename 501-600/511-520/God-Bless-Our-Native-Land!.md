    1.
    God bless our native land! 
    May Heaven's protecting hand 
    Still guard our shore. 
    May peace her power extend, 
    Foe be transformed to friend, 
    And all our rights depend 
    On war no more. 

    2.
    May just and righteous laws 
    Uphold the public cause, 
    And bless our name; 
    Home of the brave and free, 
    Stronghold of liberty, 
    We pray that still on thee 
    May rest no stain. 

    3.
    And not this land alone, 
    But be Thy mercies known 
    From shore to shore; 
    O that all men would see 
    That they should brothers he, 
    And form one family, 
    The wide world o'er!
