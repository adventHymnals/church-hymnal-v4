    1.
    Gentle Peace, from heaven descended, 
    We would live beneath Thy law; 
    Thou hast home and life befriended, 
    Born of nobler deeds than war. 

    2.
    Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty 
    O'er the meadow, hill, and grove; 
    Thou hast quickened us to duty, 
    Thou hast warmed our hearts to love. 

    3.
    Stay Thou with us, still replenish 
    Fields with fruit, ourselves with love; 
    Discord and dissension banish, 
    Peaceful Spirit from above.
