[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQMoJnLYhVU9GyVHmCCsxp__dtWWlNrl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love to tell the story 
    Of unseen things above, 
    Of Jesus and His glory, 
    Of Jesus and His love. 
    I love to tell the story, 
    Because I know 'tis true;
    It satisfies my longings 
    As nothing else can do. 
    CHORUS:
    I love to tell the story, 
    'Twill be my theme in glory,
    To tell the old, old story 
    Of Jesus and His love.

    2.
    I love to tell the story; 
    More wonderful it seems 
    Than all the golden fancies 
    Of all our golden dreams. 
    I love to tell the story, 
    It did so much for me; 
    And that is just the reason 
    I tell it now to thee. 

    3.
    I love to tell the story; 
    'Tis pleasant to repeat
    What seems, each time I tell it, 
    More wonderfully sweet. 
    I love to tell the story, 
    For some have never heard 
    The message of salvation 
    From God's own Holy Word.

    4.
    I love to tell the story, 
    For those who know it best 
    Seem hungering and thirsting 
    To hear it like the rest. 
    And when, in scenes of glory, 
    I sing the new, new song, 
    'Twill be the old, old story
    That I have loved so long.
