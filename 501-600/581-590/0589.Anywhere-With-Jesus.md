[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozoQGB5Trh2JnE-0B7mIsGtI1Da8PWod/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
    Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
    Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
    Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
    CHORUS:
    Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
    Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

    2.
    Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
    Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
    Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
    Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

    3.
    Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
    When the darkening shadows round about me creep,
    Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
    Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
