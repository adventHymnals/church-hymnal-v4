    1.
    Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
    Living with Jesus, a new life divine,
    Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
    Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
    CHORUS:
    Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;
    Moment by moment I've life from above;
    Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
    Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

    2.
    Never a trial that He is not there,
    Never a burden that He doth not bear,
    Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
    Moment by moment I'm under His care.

    3.
    Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
    Never a teardrop and never a moan;
    Never a danger but there on the throne,
    Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

    4.
    Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
    Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
    Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
    Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
