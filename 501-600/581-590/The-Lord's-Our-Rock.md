    1.
    The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide, 
    A shelter in the time of storm; 
    Secure whatever may betide, 
    A shelter in the time of storm. 
    Refrain:
    Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
    Cooling shade on the burning sand; 
    Faithful guide for the pilgrim band' 
    A Shelter in the time of storm. 

    2.
    A shade by day, defense by night, 
    A shelter in the time of storm; 
    No fears alarm, no foes affright, 
    A shelter in the time of storm. 

    3.
    The raging floods may round us beat, 
    A shelter in the time of storm 
    We find in God a safe retreat, 
    A shelter in the time of storm. 

    4.
    O Rock divine, O Refuge dear, 
    A shelter in the time of storm; 
    Be Thou our Helper, ever near, 
    A shelter in the time of storm.
