    1.
    'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
    Just to take Him at His word; 
    Just to rest upon His promise, 
    Just to know, Thus saith the Lord. 
    CHORUS:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! 
    How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! 
    O for grace to trust Him more! 

    2.
    O how sweet to trust in Jesus, 
    Just to trust His cleansing blood; 
    Just in simple faith to plunge me 
    'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

    3.
    Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
    Just from sin and self to cease; 
    Just from Jesus simply taking 
    Life and rest, and joy and peace. 

    4.
    I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
    Precious Jesus, Savior, friend; 
    And I know that Thou art with me, 
    Wilt be with me to the end.
