    1.
    Christ is knocking at my sad heart; 
    Shall I let Him in? 
    Patiently pleading with my sad heart; 
    O shall I let Him in? 
    Cold and proud is my heart with sin, 
    Dark and cheerless is all within; 
    Christ is bidding me turn unto Him; 
    O shall I let Him in? 

    2.
    Shall I send Him the loving word? 
    Shall I let Him in? 
    Meekly accepting my gracious Lord, 
    O shall I let Him in? 
    He can infinite love impart, 
    He can pardon this rebel heart; 
    Shall I bid Him forever depart, 
    Or shall I let Him in? 

    3.
    Yes, I'll open this proud heart's door, 
    Yes, I'll let Him in. 
    Gladly I'll welcome Him evermore; 
    O, yes,' I'll let Him in. 
    Blessed Saviour, abide with me, 
    Cares and trials will lighter be; 
    I am safe if I'm only with Thee, 
    O, blessed Lord, come in!
