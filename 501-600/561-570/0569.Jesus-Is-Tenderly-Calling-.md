    1.
    Jesus is tenderly calling thee home' 
    Calling today, calling today; 
    Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam 
    Farther and farther away? 
    REFRAIN:
    Calling today, calling today; 
    Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today. 

    2.
    Jesus is calling the weary to rest' 
    Calling today, calling today; 
    Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest; 
    He will not turn thee away. 

    3.
    Jesus is waiting'oh, come to Him now' 
    Waiting today, waiting today; 
    Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow; 
    Come, and no longer delay. 

    4.
    Jesus is pleading'oh, list to His voice' 
    Hear Him today, hear Him today; 
    They who believe on His name shall rejoice; 
    Quickly arise and away.
