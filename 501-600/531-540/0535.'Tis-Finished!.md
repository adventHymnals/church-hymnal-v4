    1.
    "'Tis finished!" so the Saviour cried, 
    And meekly bowed His head, and died; 
    'Tis finished! yes, the race is run, 
    The battle fought, the victory won. 

    2.
    'Tis finished! that which heaven foretold 
    By prophets in the days of old; 
    And truths are opened to our view 
    That kings and prophets never knew.

    3.
    'Tis finished! Son of God, Thy power 
    Hath triumphed in this awful hour; 
    And yet our eyes with sorrow see 
    That life to us was death to Thee.

    4.
    'Tis finished! let the joyful sound 
    Be heard through all the nations round; 
    'Tis finished! let the triumph rise, 
    And swell the chorus of the skies!
