    1.
    I have a Friend so precious, 
    So very dear to me, 
    He loves me with a tender love, 
    He loves me faithfully; 
    I could not live apart from Him, 
    I love to feel Him nigh; 
    And so we dwell together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    2.
    Sometimes I'm faint and weary, 
    He knows that I am weak; 
    And as He bids me lean on Him, 
    His help I'll gladly seek; 
    He leads me in the path of light, 
    Beneath a sunny sky; 
    And so we walk together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    3.
    I tell Him all my sorrows, 
    I tell Him all my joys, 
    I tell Him all that pleases me, 
    I tell Him what annoys; 
    He tells me what I ought to do, 
    Hs tells me how to try; 
    And so we talk together, 
    My Lord and I. 

    4.
    He knows how I am longing 
    Some weary soul to win, 
    And so He bids me go and speak 
    The loving word for Him; 
    He bids me tell His wondrous love, 
    And why He came to die; 
    And so we work together, 
    My Lord and I.
