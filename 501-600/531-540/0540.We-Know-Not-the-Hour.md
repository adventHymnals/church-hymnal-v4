    1.
    We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;
    Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
    When He shall return 'tis a promise most cheering
    But we know not the hour.
    CHORUS:
    He will come (He will come), let us watch and be ready;
    He will come (He will come), hallelujah! hallelujah!
    He will come in the clouds of His Father's bright glory--
    But we know not the hour.

    2.
    There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
    There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
    Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
    But we know not the hour.

    3.
    We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
    We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
    We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
    But we know not the hour.
