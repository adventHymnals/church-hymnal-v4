    1.

    0. spread the tidings round, 
    Wherever man is found, 
    Wherever human hearts 
    And human woes abound; 
    Let every Christian tongue 
    Proclaim the joyful sound: 
    The Comforter has come! 

    2.
    The long, long night is past, 
    The morning breaks at last; 
    And hushed the dreadful wail 
    And fury of the blast, 
    As o'er the golden hills 
    The day advances fast. 
    The Comforter has come! 

    3.
    O boundless Love divine! 
    How shall this tongue of mine 
    To wondering mortals tell 
    The matchless grace divine' 
    That I, a child of sin, 
    Should in His image shine! 
    The Comforter has come! 

    4.
    Sing, 'till the echoes fly 
    Above the vaulted sky, 
    And all the saints above 
    To all below reply, 
    In strains of endless love, 
    The song that ne'er will die: 
    The Comforter has come!
