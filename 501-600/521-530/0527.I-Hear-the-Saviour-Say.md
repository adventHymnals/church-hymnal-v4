    1.
    I hear the Savior say, 
    'Thy strength indeed is small, 
    Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
    Find in Me thine all in all.' 
    Refrain:
    Jesus paid it all, 
    All to Him I owe; 
    Sin had left a crimson stain; 
    He washed it white as snow. 

    2.
    Lord, now indeed I find 
    Thy power, and Thine alone, 
    Can change the leper's spots, 
    And melt the heart of stone. 

    3.
    Since nothing good have I 
    Whereby Thy grace to claim, 
    I'll wash my garments white 
    In the blood of Calvary's Lamb. 

    4.
    And when before the throne 
    I stand in Him complete, 
    I'll lay my trophies down, 
    All down at Jesus' feet.
