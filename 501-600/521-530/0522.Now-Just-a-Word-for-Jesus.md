    1.
    Now, just a word for Jesus; 
    Your dearest Friend so true, 
    Come, cheer our hearts and tell us 
    What He has done for you. 
    Refrain:
    Now just a word for Jesus 
    'Twill help us on our way; 
    One little word for Jesus, 
    O speak, or sing, or pray. 

    2.
    Now just a word for Jesus; 
    You feel your sins forgiven, 
    And by His grace are striving 
    To reach a home in heaven. 

    3.
    Now just a word for Jesus; 
    A cross it cannot be 
    To say, "I love my Saviour 
    Who gave His life for me." 

    4.
    Now just a word for Jesus; 
    Let not the time be lost; 
    The heart's neglected duty 
    Brings sorrow to its cost. 

    5.
    Now just a word for Jesus; 
    And if your faith be dim, 
    Arise in all your weakness, 
    And leave the rest to Him.
