    1.
    The golden morning is fast approaching; 
    Jesus soon will come 
    To take His faithful and happy children 
    To their promised home. 
    Refrain:
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning 
    Piercing through this night of gloom! 
    O, we see the gleams of the golden morning 
    That will burst the tomb. 

    2.
    The Gospel summons will soon be carried 
    To the nations round; 
    The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry 
    And the trumpet sound. 

    3.
    Attended by all the shining angels, 
    Down the flaming sky 
    The Judge will come, and will take His people 
    Where they will not die. 

    4.
    There those loved ones who have long been parted 
    Will all meet that day; 
    The tears of those who are brokenhearted 
    Will be wiped away.
