    1.
    We know not the time when he cometh, 
    At even, or midnight, or morn; 
    It may be at deepening twilight, 
    It may be at earliest dawn. 
    He bids us to watch and be ready, 
    Nor suffer our lights to grow dim; 
    That, when he may come, he will find us 
    All waiting and watching for him. 
    Refrain:
    Waiting and watching, 
    Waiting and watching, 
    Waiting and watching, 
    Still waiting and watching for him. 

    2.
    I think of his wonderful pity, 
    The price our salvation hath cost; 
    He left the bright mansions of glory 
    To suffer and die for the lost. 
    And, sometimes, I think it will please him, 
    When those whom he died to redeem, 
    Rejoice in the hope of his coming, 
    By waiting and watching for him. 

    3.
    O Jesus, my loving Redeemer, 
    Thou knowest I cherish as dear 
    The hope that mine eyes shall behold thee, 
    That I shall thine own welcome hear. 
    If to some as a judge thou appearest, 
    Who forth from thy presence would flee, 
    A Friend most beloved I'll greet thee; 
    I'm waiting and watching for thee.
