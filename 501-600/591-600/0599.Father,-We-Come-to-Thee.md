    1.
    Father, we come to Thee, 
    No other help have we; 
    Thou wilt our refuge be, 
    On Thee we call, 
    Earth is but dark and drear 
    Without Thy presence near; 
    Be Thou our comfort here, 
    Father of all. 
    Refrain:
    Father, we come to Thee, 
    Turn not away; 
    Helpless we come to Thee, 
    Hear while we pray. 

    2.
    Save from our many foes, 
    Savefrom our earthly woes; 
    Be Thou our soul's repose 
    In time of need. 
    Doubting are we, and weak; 
    To us sweet courage speak; 
    Thy mighty arm we seek 
    For strength indeed. 

    3.
    Give us Thy grace divine, 
    Seal us forever Thine; 
    Our wayward feet incline 
    From sin to flee. 
    Oh, guide us, we implore, 
    Till weary life is o'er, 
    And on a brighter shore 
    We dwell with Thee.
