    1.
    Jesus, keep me near the cross, 
    There a precious fountain 
    Free to all, a healing stream, 
    Flows from Calvary's mountain. 
    Refrain:
    In the cross, in the cross, 
    Be my glory ever, 
    Till my raptured soul shall find 
    Rest beyond the river. 

    2.
    Near the cross, a trembling soul, 
    Love and mercy found me; 
    There the bright and Morning Star 
    Sheds its beams around me. 

    3.
    Near the cross! O Lamb of God, 
    Bring its scenes before me; 
    Help me walk from day to day, 
    With its shadow o'er me. 

    4.
    Near the cross I'll watch and wait, 
    Hoping, trusting ever, 
    Till I reach the golden strand, 
    Just beyond the river.
