    1.
    Oh now I see the crimson wave,
    The fountain deep and wide;
    Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
    Points to His wounded side.
    CHORUS:
    The cleansing stream I see, I see,
    I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!
    O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,
    It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

    2.
    I see the new creation rise,
    I hear the speaking blood;
    It speaks polluted nature dies,
    Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

    3.
    I rise to walk in heaven's own light,
    Above the world and sin;
    With heart made pure and garments white,
    And Christ enthroned within.

    4.
    Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below
    To feel the blood applied,
    And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
    My Jesus crucified.
