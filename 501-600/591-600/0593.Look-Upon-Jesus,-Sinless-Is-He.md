[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUHdudSFi6poQhpmxrdDC8PfgSNShAMN/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Look upon Jesus, sinless is He; 
    Father, impute His life unto me. 
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe, 
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow. 
    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow; 
    Fullness of His life then shall I know; 
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe, 
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow. 

    2.
    Deep are the wounds transgression has made; 
    Red are the stains; my soul is afraid. 
    O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee, 
    Safe from the law that now judgeth me! 

    3.
    Longing the joy of pardon to know; 
    Jesus holds out a robe white as snow; 
    'Lord, I accept it! leaving my own, 
    Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.' 

    4.
    Reconciled by His death for my sin, 
    Justified by His life pure and clean, 
    Sanctified by obeying His Word, 
    Glorified when returneth my Lord.
