    1.
    I know my heavenly Father knows 
    The storms that would my way oppose; 
    But He can drive the clouds away. 
    And turn my darkness into day, 
    And turn my darkness into day. 
    Refrain:
    He knows, He knows 
    The storms that would my way oppose; 
    He knows, He knows, 
    And tempers every wind that blows. 

    2.
    I know my heavenly Father knows 
    The balm I need to soothe my woes; 
    And with His touch of love divine 
    He heals this wounded soul of mine, 
    He heals this wounded soul of mine. 

    3.
    I know my heavenly Father knows 
    How frail I am to meet my foes; 
    But He my cause will e'er defend, 
    Uphold and keep me to the end, 
    Uphold and keep me to the end. 

    4.
    I know my heavenly Father knows 
    The hour my journey here will close; 
    And may that hour, O faithful Guide, 
    Find me safe sheltered by Thy side, 
    Find me safe sheltered by Thy side.
