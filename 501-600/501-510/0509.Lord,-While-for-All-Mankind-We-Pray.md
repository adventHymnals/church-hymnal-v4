[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNteo9Nvt0jx94lhtCj1Lf84LBGnFVU1/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, while for all mankind we pray
    Of every clime and coast,
    O hear us for our native land,
    The land we love the most!

    2.
    O guard our shores from every foe,
    With peace our borders bless;
    With prosperous times our cities crown,
    Our fields with plenteousness!

    3.
    Unite us in the sacred love
    Of knowledge, truth, and Thee;
    And let our hills and valleys shout
    The songs of liberty.

    4.
    Lord of the nations, thus to Thee
    Our country we commend;
    Be Thou her Refuge and her trust,
    Her everlasting friend.
