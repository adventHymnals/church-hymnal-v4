    1.
    God save our gracious king, 
    Long live our noble king, 
    God save the king. 
    Send him victorious, 
    Happy and glorious, 
    Long to reign over us, 
    God save the king. 

    2.
    Thy choicest gifts in store, 
    On him be pleased to pour; 
    Long may he reign. 
    May he defend our laws, 
    And ever give us cause 
    To sing with heart and voice, 
    God save the king.
