[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVTaUVXMysRI9Fv4AKtCqdNB-Watc7fl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My country, 'tis of thee, 
    Sweet land of liberty, 
    Of thee I sing; 
    Land where my fathers died, 
    Land of the pilgrims' pride, 
    From every mountainside 
    Let freedom ring. 

    2.
    My native country, thee, 
    Land of the noble free, 
    Thy name I love; 
    I love thy rocks and rills, 
    Thy woods and templed hills; 
    My heart with rapture thrills 
    Like that above. 

    3.
    Let music swell the breeze, 
    And ring from all the trees 
    Sweet freedom's song: 
    Let mortal tongues awake; 
    Let all that breathe partake; 
    Let rocks their silence break, 
    The sound prolong. 

    4.
    Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
    Author of liberty, 
    To Thee we sing: 
    Long may our land be bright 
    With freedom's holy light; 
    Protect us by Thy might, 
    Great God, our King.
