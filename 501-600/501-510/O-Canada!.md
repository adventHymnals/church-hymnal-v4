    1.
    O Canada! Our home and native land! 
    True patriot love in all thy sons command. 
    With glowing hearts we see thee rise 
    The True North strong and free; 
    And stand on guard, 0 Canada, 
    We stand on guard for thee. 
    Refrain:
    O Canada! Glorious and free! 
    We stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee. 
    O Canada! We stand on guard for thee 

    2.
    O Canada! Where pines and maples grow, 
    Great prairies spread and lordly rivers flow. 
    How dear to us thy broad domain, 
    From east to western sea! 
    Thou land of hope for all who toil! 
    Thou True North strong and free. 

    3.
    O Canada! Beneath thy shining skies 
    May stalwart sons and gentle maidens rise 
    To keep thee steadfast through the years 
    From east to western sea, 
    Our own beloved native land, 
    Our True North strong and free! 

    4.
    Ruler supreme who hearest humble prayer, 
    Hold our Dominion in Thy loving care. 
    Help us to find, 0 God, in Thee 
    A lasting rich reward, 
    As waiting for the better day, 
    We ever stand on guard.
