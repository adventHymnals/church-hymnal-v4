[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6u5xOwMLV7Tob5MCb36GsMvmPJckECq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Have I need of aught, O Saviour! 
    Aught on earth but Thee? 
    Have I any in the heavens, 
    Anyone but Thee? 
    REFRAIN:
    Only Thee, only Thee. 
    O the wondrous love shown me! 
    Only Thee, only Thee, 
    None on earth but Thee. 

    2.
    Though I have of friends so many. 
    Love, and gold. and health, 
    If I have not Thee, my Saviour, 
    Hold I any wealth? 

    3.
    Is there heart so kind and patient 
    With my failings all? 
    Or a voice so true and ready, 
    Answering my call? 

    4.
    Not for worlds would I exchange it' 
    This sweet faith in Thee! 
    Earthly treasures cannot equal 
    All Thou art to me.
