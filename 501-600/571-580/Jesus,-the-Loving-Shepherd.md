    1.
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
    Calleth thee now to come 
    Into the fold of safety, 
    Where there is rest and room; 
    Come in the strength of manhood, 
    Come in the morn of youth, 
    Enter the fold of safety, 
    Enter the way of truth. 
    Refrain:
    Lovingly, tenderly calling is He: 
    Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me; 
    Patiently standing there, waiting. I see 
    Jesus my Shepherd divine. 

    2.
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
    Gave His dear life for thee; 
    Tenderly now He's calling, 
    Wanderer, come to Me; 
    Haste, for without is danger, 
    Come, cries the Shepherd blest, 
    Enter the fold of safety, 
    Enter the place of rest. 

    3.
    Lingering is but folly; 
    Wolves are abroad today, 
    Seeking the sheep now straying, 
    Seeking the lambs to slay; 
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
    Calleth thee now to come 
    Into the fold of safety, 
    Where there is rest and room.
