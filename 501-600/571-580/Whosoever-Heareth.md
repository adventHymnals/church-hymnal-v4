    1.
    "Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound! 
    Send the blessed tidings all the world around; 
    Spread the joyful news wherever man is found: 
    "Whosoever will may come." 
    Refrain:
    "Whosoever will, whosoever will," 
    Send the proclamation over vale and hill; 
    'Tis a loving Father calls the wanderer home; 
    Whosoever will may come. 

    2.
    Whosoever cometh need not delay; 
    Now the door is open, enter while you may; 
    Jesus is the true, the only living way: 
    Whosoever will may come. 

    3.
    "Whosoever will," the promise is secure, 
    "Whosoever will," forever must endure; 
    "Whosoever will," 'tis life forevermore; 
    Whosoever will may come.
