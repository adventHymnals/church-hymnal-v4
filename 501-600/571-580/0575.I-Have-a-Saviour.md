    1.
    I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory, 
    A dear loving Savior, though earth friends be few; 
    And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me, 
    But oh, that my Savior were your Saviour, too. 
    Refrain:
    For you I am praying, 
    For you I am praying, 
    For you I am praying, 
    I'm praying for you. 

    2.
    I have a Father; to me He has given 
    A hope for eternity, blessed and true; 
    And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven, 
    But oh that He'd let me bring you with me too! 

    3.
    I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness, 
    Awaiting in glory my wondering view; 
    Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness, 
    Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too! 

    4.
    When Jesus has found you, tell others the story, 
    That my loving Saviour is your Saviour, too; 
    Then pray that your Saviour will bring them to glory, 
    And prayer will be answered''twas answered for you!
