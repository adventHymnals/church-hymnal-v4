    1.
    On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
    And cast a wishful eye
    To Canaan's fair and happy land,
    Where my possessions lie.
    CHORUS:
    I am bound for the promised land,
    I am bound for the promised land;
    O who will come and go with me?
    I am bound for the promised land.

    2.
    O'er all those wide extended plains
    Shines one eternal day;
    There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,
    And scatters night away.

    3.
    When shall I reach that happy place,
    And be forever blest?
    When shall I see my Father's face,
    And in His kingdom rest?

    4.
    Filled with delight, my raptured soul
    Would here no longer stay;
    Though Jordan's waves around me roll,
    Fearless I'd launch away.
