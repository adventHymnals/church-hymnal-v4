[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDU_VZbv%2DV7nkEqQfYtmybDsdn6QV1yq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Pass me not, O gentle Savior, 
    Hear my humble cry; 
    While on others Thou art calling, 
    Do not pass me by. 
    REFRAIN:
    Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry, 
    While on others Thou art calling, 
    Do not pass me by. 

    2.
    Let me at Thy throne of mercy 
    Find a sweet relief; 
    Kneeling there in deep contrition, 
    Help my unbelief. 

    3.
    Trusting only in Thy merit, 
    Would I seek Thy face; 
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit, 
    Save me by Thy grace. 

    4.
    Thou the spring of all my comfort, 
    More than life to me, 
    Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
    Whom in heaven but Thee?
