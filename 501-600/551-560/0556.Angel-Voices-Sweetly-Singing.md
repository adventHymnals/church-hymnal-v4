    1.
    Angel voices sweetly singing, 
    Echoes through the blue dome ringing, 
    News of wondrous gladness bringing; 
    Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 
    REFRAIN:
    Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
    O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
    Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
    Endless, boundless glory, In heaven at last. 

    2.
    On the jasper threshold standing, 
    Like a pilgrim safely landing, 
    See the strange bright scene expanding; 
    Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

    3.
    Softest voices, silver pealing, 
    Freshest fragrance, spirit healing, 
    Happy hymns around us stealing; 
    Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

    4.
    Not a teardrop ever falleth, 
    Not a pleasure ever palleth, 
    Song to song forever calleth; 
    Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

    5.
    Christ Himself the living splendor, 
    Christ the sunlight, mild and tender;v 
    Praise to the Lamb we render; 
    Ah, 'tis heaven at last!
