    1.
    The sun is on the land and sea, 
    The day begun; 
    Our morning hymn begins with Thee, 
    Blest Three in One: 
    Our praise shall rise continually 
    Till day is done. 

    2.
    Thy love was ever in our view, 
    Like stars, by night; 
    Thy gifts are ev'ry morning new, 
    O God of light; 
    Thy mercy, like the heavens' blue, 
    Fills all our sight. 

    3.
    We do not know what grief or care 
    The day may bring: 
    The heart shall find some gladness there 
    That loves its King; 
    The life that serves Thee ev'rywhere 
    Can always sing. 

    4.
    All glory to the Father be, 
    With Christ the Son, 
    And, Holy Spirit, unto Thee, 
    Forever One; 
    All glory to the Trinity 
    While ages run.
