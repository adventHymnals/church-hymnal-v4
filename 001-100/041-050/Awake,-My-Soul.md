[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0pKfnMqMtLub1iqoXVMtuMM%2DA81aJVc/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Awake, my soul, and with the sun 
    Thy daily stage of duty run; 
    Shake off dull sloth, and early rise 
    To pay thy morning sacrifice ! 

    2.
    Shine on me, Lord; new life impart ! 
    Fresh ardors kindle in my heart; 
    One ray of Thine all quickening light 
    Dispels the clouds and dark of night. 

    3.
    Direct, control, suggest this day 
    All I design, or do, or say, 
    That all my power's, with all their might, 
    In Thy sole glory may unite. 

    4.
    Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; 
    Praise him, all creatures here below; 
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host; 
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
