[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7fXHPYh2UOyts8o-7HBGYjSJPfdaJe1/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Forth in Thy Name, O Lord, I go, 
    My daily labor to pursue; 
    Thee, only Thee, resolved to know 
    In all I think, or speak, or do. 

    2.
    The task Thy wisdom hath assigned 
    O let me cheerfully fulfill; 
    In all my works Thy presence find, 
    And prove Thy good and perfect will. 

    3.
    Give me to bear Thy easy yoke, 
    And every moment watch and pray; 
    And still to things eternal look, 
    And hasten to Thy glorious day: 

    4.
    For Thee delightfully employ 
    Whate'er Thy bounteous grace hath given; 
    And run my course with even joy, 
    And closely walk with Thee to heaven.
