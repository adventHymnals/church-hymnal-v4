    1.
    Softly now the light of day
    Fades upon out sight away:
    Free from care, from labor free,
    Lord, we would commune with Thee.

    2.
    Thou, whose allpervading eye
    Nought escapes, without, within,
    Pardon each infirmity,
    Open fault, and secret sin.

    3.
    Soon from us the light of day
    Shall forever pass away;
    Then, from sin and sorrow free,
    Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
