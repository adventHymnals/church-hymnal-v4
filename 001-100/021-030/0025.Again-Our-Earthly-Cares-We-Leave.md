[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S10TZ1wvVRrc02kSr14bd7QJPC_5qi7f/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Again our earthly cares we leave, 
    And to Thy courts repair; 
    Again with joyful feet we taste 
    To meet our Saviour there. 

    2.
    Great Shepherd of Thy people, here 
    Thy presence now display. 
    We bow within Thy house of prayer; 
    O give us hearts to pray! 

    3.
    The clouds which veil Thee from our sight, 
    In pity, Lord, remove; 
    Dispose our minds to hear aright 
    The message of Thy love. 

    4.
    The feeling heart, the melting eyes, 
    The humble mind, bestow; 
    And shine upon us from above, 
    To make our graces grow.
