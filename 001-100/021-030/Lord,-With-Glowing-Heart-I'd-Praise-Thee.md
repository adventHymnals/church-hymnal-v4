    1.
    Lord, with glowing heart I'd praise Thee 
    For the bliss Thy love bestows; 
    For the pardoning grace that saves me, 
    And the peace that from it flows: 
    Help, O God, my weak endeavor: 
    This dull soul to rapture raise; 
    Thou must light the flame, or never 
    Can my soul be warmed to praise. 

    2.
    Praise, my soul, the God that sought thee, 
    Wretched wanderer, far astray; 
    Found thee lost, and kindly brought thee 
    From the paths of death away. 
    Praise, with love's devoutest feeling, 
    Him who saw they guiltborn fear, 
    And, the light of hope revealing, 
    Bade the bloodstained cross appear. 

    3.
    Lord, this bossom's ardent feeling 
    Vainly would my lips express. 
    Low before Thy footstool kneeling, 
    Deign Thy suppliant's prayer to bless; 
    Let Thy grace, my soul's chief treasure, 
    Love's pure flame within me raise; 
    And, since words can never measure, 
    Let my life show forth Thy praise.
