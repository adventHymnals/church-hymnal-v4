    1.
    The Sabbath day has reached its close, 
    Yet, Saviour, ere I seek repose, 
    Grant me the peace Thy love bestows; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    2.
    Weary I come to Thee for rest; 
    Hallow and calm my troubled breast; 
    Grant me Thy Spirit for my guest; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    3.
    Let not the gospel seed remain 
    Unfruitful, or be sown in vain; 
    Let heavenly dews descend like rain; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    4.
    O Jesus, Lord enthroned on high, 
    Thou hearest the contrite spirit's sigh; 
    Look down on me with pitying eye; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    5.
    My only intercessor Thou, 
    Mingle Thy fragrant incense now 
    With every prayer and every vow; 
    Smile on my evening hour. 

    6.
    And, oh, when time's short course shall end, 
    And death's dark shades around impend, 
    My God, my everlasting Friend, 
    Smile on my evening hour.
