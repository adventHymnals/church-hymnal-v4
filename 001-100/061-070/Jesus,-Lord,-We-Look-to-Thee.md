    1.
    Jesus, Lord, we look to thee; 
    Let us in Thy name agree; 
    Show Thyself the Prince of Peace, 
    Bid our strife forever cease. 

    2.
    By Thy reconciling love 
    Every stumbling block remove; 
    Each to each unite, endear; 
    Come, and spread Thy banner here. 

    3.
    Make us of one heart and mind, 
    Courteous, pitiful and kind, 
    Lowly, meek, in thought and word, 
    Altogether like our Lord. 

    4.
    Let us for each other care, 
    Each the other's burdens bear; 
    To Thy church the pattern give, 
    Show how true believers live. 

    5.
    Free from anger and from pride, 
    Let us thus in God abide; 
    May our daily life express, 
    Constant love and holiness. 

    6.
    Let us then with joy remove 
    To the family above; 
    On the wings of angels fly, 
    To our mansions in the sky.
