[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QP_17w9Ch6cCzufeoBCw6Mx3DNaykp1B/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Like as a father pities his child, 
    So the Lord pities the sinner defiled; 
    Waiteth in kindness, 
    Pities our blindness, 
    Longeth to welcome, though often reviled. 

    2.
    Like as a father when we believe, 
    Merciful still, He will gladly receive; 
    Listens to hear us, 
    Blesses to cheer us, 
    Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve. 

    3.
    Like as a father, ever the same, 
    He hath created, and knoweth our frame; 
    Watcheth the straying, 
    Guardeth the praying, 
    Bids us to trust in His almighty name. 

    4.
    Like as a father, constant is He, 
    God in compassion regardeth our plea; 
    In need He cometh, 
    Precious His promise: 
    Father in heaven forever to be.
