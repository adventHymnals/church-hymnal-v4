    1.
    Again, as evening's shadow falls, 
    We gather in these hallowed walls; 
    And vesper hymn and vesper prayer 
    Rise mingling on the holy air. 

    2.
    May struggling hearts that seek release 
    Here find the rest of God's own peace; 
    And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer, 
    Lay down the burden and the care. 

    3.
    O God, our Light! to Thee we bow; 
    Within all shadows standest Thou; 
    Give deeper calm than night can bring; 
    Give sweeter songs than lips can sing. 
    Amen.
