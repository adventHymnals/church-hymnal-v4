    1.
    O blessed hour, when evening comes, 
    And calls us to our place of prayer ! 
    with joyful heart our feet we turn 
    To meet Thee and Thy children there. 

    2.
    With one accord we gather here, 
    Our wants make known, our sins confess; 
    Dear Saviour, wilt Thou now appear, 
    And bless as only Thou canst bless. 

    3.
    Our faith increase, our fears remove; 
    Make strong the weak, the helpless raise; 
    May every heart now feel Thy love, 
    And every tongue speak forth Thy praise. 

    4.
    No want have we Thou canst not fill, 
    No need but Thou canst fully meet; 
    May we obey Thy gracious will, 
    And find our lives in Thee complete.
