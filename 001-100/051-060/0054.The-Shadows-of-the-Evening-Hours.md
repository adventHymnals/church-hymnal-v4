    1.
    The shadows of the evening hours 
    Fall from the darkening sky, 
    Upon the fragrance of the flowers 
    The dews of evening lie. 
    Before Thy throne, O Lord of heaven, 
    We kneel at close of day; 
    Look on Thy children from on high, 
    And hear us while we pray. 

    2.
    The sorrows of Thy servants, Lord, 
    O do not Thou despise, 
    But let the incense of our prayers 
    Before Thy mercy rise; 
    The brightness of the coming night 
    Upon the darkness rolls; 
    With hopes of future glory chase 
    The shadows on our souls. 

    3.
    Let peace, O Lord! Thy peace, O God, 
    Upon our souls descend; 
    From midnight fears, and perils, Thou 
    Our trembling hearts defend: 

    8.Give us a respite from our toil, 
    Calm and subdue our woes; 
    Through the long day we labor, Lord, 
    O give us now repose.
