    1.
    The sun rolls down the distant west. 
    Soft twilight steals abroad 
    To welcome in the day of rest, 
    The Sabbath of our Lord. 

    2.
    This holy day let us begin 
    With songs of praise to God, 
    Who pardons all our guilt and sin. 
    Through Jesus' precious blood. 

    3.
    Now in this tranquil hour we lay 
    All worldly cares aside, 
    And hallow God's most holy day, 
    Though friends or foes may chide. 

    4.
    'Tis not to seek the world's applause 
    That we from labor rest; 
    We strive to keep God's holy laws, 
    And He these moments blessed.
