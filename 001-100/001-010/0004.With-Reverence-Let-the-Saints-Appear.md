    1.
    With reverence let the saints appear, 
    And bow before the Lord; 
    His high commands with reverence hear, 
    And tremble at His word; 
    And tremble at His word.

    2.
    How terrible Thy glories be! 
    How bright Thine armies shine! 
    Where is the power that vies with Thee, 
    Or truth compared with Thine? 
    Or truth compared with Thine? 

    3.
    Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord, 
    Your great Deliverer sing; 
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound, 
    Be joyful in your King; 
    Be joyful in your King. 

    4.
    O Jesus, Lord of earth and heaven, 
    Our life and joy, to Thee 
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing given 
    Through all eternity; 
    Through all eternity.
