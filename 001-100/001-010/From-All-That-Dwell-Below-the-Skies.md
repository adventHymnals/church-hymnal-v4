    1.
    From all that dwell below the skies 
    Let the Creator's praise arise; 
    Let His almighty name be sung 
    Through every land, by every tongue.

    2.
    Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord, 
    Eternal truth attends Thy word; 
    Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
    Till suns shall rise and set no more. 

    3.
    Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring, 
    In songs of praise divinely sing; 
    God's great salvation loud proclaim, 
    And shout for joy His glorious name.

    4.
    In every land begin the song, 
    To every land the strains belong; 
    In cheerful sounds all voices raise, 
    And fill the world with loudest praise.
