    1.
    God's free mercy streameth 
    Over all the world, 
    And His banner gleameth, 
    By His church unfurled; 
    Broad and deep and glorious, 
    As the heaven above, 
    Shines in might victorious 
    His eternal love. 

    2.
    Summer suns are glowing 
    Over land and sea; 
    Happy light is flowing, 
    Bountiful and free; 
    Everything rejoices 
    In the mellow rays; 
    Earth's ten thousand voices 
    Swell the psalm of praise.

    3.
    Lord, upon our blindness 
    Thy pure radiance pour; 
    For Thy lovingkindness 
    We would love Thee more; 
    And when clouds are drifting 
    Dark across the sky, 
    Then, the veil uplifting, 
    Father, be Thou nigh. 

    4.
    We will never doubt Thee, 
    Tho' Thou veil Thy light; 
    Life is dark without Thee, 
    Death with Thee is bright. 
    Light of light, shine o'er us 
    On our pilgrim way, 
    Go Thou still before us 
    To the endless day.
