    1.
    The glory of the spring how sweet, 
    The new-born life how glad; 
    What joy the happy earth to greet 
    In new, bright raiment clad. 
    Divine Redeemer, Thee I bless; 
    I greet Thy going forth; 
    I love Thee in the loveliness 
    Of Thy renewed earth. 

    2.
    But O these wonders of Thy grace, 
    These nobler works of Thine, 
    These marvels sweeter far to trace, 
    These new births more divine. 
    This new-born glow of faith so strong, 
    This bloom of love so fair, 
    This new-born ecstasy of song 
    And fragrancy of prayer! 

    3.
    Creator Spirit, work in me 
    These wonders sweet of Thine; 
    Divine Redeemer, graciously 
    Renew this heart of mine. 
    Still let new life and strength upspring, 
    Still let new joy be given; 
    And grant the glad new song to ring 
    Through the new earth and heaven.
