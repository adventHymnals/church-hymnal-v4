    1.
    On hills and vales of heaven, 
    Where falls no shade of gloom, 
    Where all is peace and glory, 
    Are wondrous flowers in bloom. 
    But Thou, oh, Thou art fairer 
    Than any flower that grows, 
    Our lily of the valley 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

    2.
    Within the many mansions 
    Are jewels heavenly fair; 
    But Thou art far more precious 
    Than all the treasures there; 
    Most perfect in Thy beauty 
    Of all that heaven knows, 
    Our pearl of price forever, 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose. 

    3.
    The flowers of earth have perished, 
    Its glories all have died; 
    For where all joys were transient 
    No beauty could abide; 
    But Thou art ours forever, 
    Where life's bright river flows, 
    Our lily of the valley 
    And Sharon's fadeless rose.
