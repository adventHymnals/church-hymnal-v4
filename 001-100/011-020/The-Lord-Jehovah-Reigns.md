    1.
    The Lord Jehovah reigns, 
    His throne is built on high; 
    The garments He assumes 
    Are light and majesty. 
    His glories shine with beams so bright 
    No mortal eye can bear the sight. 

    2.
    The thunders of His hand 
    Keep the wide world in awe; 
    His wrath and justice stand 
    To guard His holy law. 
    And where His love resolves to bless, 
    His truth confirms and seals the grace. 

    3.
    Through all His mighty works 
    Amazing wisdom shines; 
    Confounds the powers of hell, 
    And all their designs. 
    Strong is His arm, and shall fulfill 
    His great decrees and sovereign will. 

    4.
    And will this sovereign King 
    Of glory condescend, 
    And will He write His name 
    My father and my Friend? 
    I love His name, I love His word; 
    Join all my powers to praise the Lord!
