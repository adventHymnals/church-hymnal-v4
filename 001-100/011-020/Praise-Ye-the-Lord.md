    1.
    Praise ye the Lord! 'tis good to raise 
    Your hearts and voices in His praise; 
    His nature and His works invite 
    To make this duty our delight. 

    2.
    He formed the stars, those heavenly flames, 
    He counts their numbers, calls their names; 
    His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound, 
    A deep where all our thoughts are drowned. 

    3.
    Sing to the Lord, exalt Him high, 
    Who spreads His clouds along the sky; 
    There He prepare the fruitful rain, 
    Nor lets the drops descend in vain. 

    4.
    He makes the grass the hills adorn, 
    And clothes the smiling fields with corn; 
    The beasts with food His hands supply, 
    And the young ravens when they cry. 

    5.
    His saints are lovely in His sight, 
    He views His children with delight; 
    He sees their hope, He knows their fear, 
    And looks and loves His image there.
