[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZHl4_oo4ODeWOmiHDGtFOu1KpdwxcyW/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The Lord be with us as we bend 
    His blessing to receive; 
    His gift of peace upon us send 
    Before His courts we leave. 

    2.
    The Lord be with us as we walk 
    Along our homeward road; 
    In silent thought or friendly talk 
    Our hearts be still with God. 

    3.
    The Lord be with us till the night 
    Infold us all to rest; 
    Be He of every heart the light, 
    Of every home the guest.
