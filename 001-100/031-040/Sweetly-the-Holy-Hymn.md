    1.
    Sweetly the holy hymn 
    Breaks on the morning air; 
    Before the world with smoke is dim 
    We meet to offer prayer. 

    2.
    While flowers are wet with dews, 
    Dew of our souls, descend; 
    Ere yet the sun the day renews, 
    O Lord, Thy Spirit send. 

    3.
    Upon the battlefield, 
    Before the fight begins, 
    We seek, O Lord, Thy sheltering shield, 
    To guard us from our sins. 

    4.
    On the lone mountainside, 
    Before the morning's light, 
    The Man of Sorrows wept and cried, 
    And rose refreshed with might. 

    5.
    Oh, hear us, then, for we 
    Are very weak and frail; 
    We make the Saviour's name our plea, 
    And surely, must prevail.
