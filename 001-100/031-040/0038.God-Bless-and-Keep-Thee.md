    1.
    God bless and keep thee through all thy days, 
    God bless and keep thee in all thy ways; 
    'Mizpah' our parting sweet, 
    'Mizpah' our hearts repeat, 
    Till we again shall meet with songs of praise. 

    2.
    How good to be where God's children meet, 
    How good to worship at Jesus' feet; 
    There love and peace abide, 
    There sweetest rest beside, 
    There every care we hide in joy complete. 

    3.
    Here in His word sweet manna is found, 
    Here living waters for all abound; 
    Jesus our need supplies, 
    And who on Him relies 
    He ever satisfies; 
    His praise resound.
