    1.
    Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us 
    O'er the world's tempestuos sea; 
    Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, 
    For we have no help but thee; 
    Yet possessing Every blessing 
    If our God our Father be. 

    2.
    Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us, 
    All our weakness thou dost know; 
    Thou didst tread this earth before us, 
    Thou didst feel its keenest woe; 
    Lone and dreary, Faint and weary, 
    Through the desert Thoudidst go. 

    3.
    Spirit of our God, descending, 
    Fill our hearts with heavenly joy; 
    Love with every passion blending, 
    Pleasure that can never cloy; 
    Thus provided, Pardoned, guided, 
    Nothing can our peace destroy.
