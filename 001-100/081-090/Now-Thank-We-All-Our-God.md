    1.
    Now thank we all our God
    With heart and hands and voices,
    Who wondrous things hath done,
    In whom His world rejoices;
    Who, from our mothers' arms
    Hath blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love,
    And still is ours today.

    2.
    O may this bounteous God
    Through all our life be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us;
    And keep us still in grace,
    And guide us when perplexed;
    And free us from all ills,
    In this world and the next.

    3.
    All praise and thanks to God
    The Father now be given;
    The Son, and Him who reigns
    With them in highest heaven;
    The one eternal God,
    Whom earth and heaven adore;
    For thus it was, is now,
    And shall be evermore.
