[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TavsNQVlBUy_37%2DVK0GLa777iDy3XoAk/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    God is the refuge of His saints, 
    When storms of sharp distress invade; 
    Ere we can offer our complaints, 
    Behold him present with His aid. 

    2.
    Loud may the troubled ocean roar; 
    In sacred peace our souls abide; 
    While every nation, every shore, 
    Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide. 

    3.
    There is a stream, whose gentle flow 
    Supplies the city of our God, 
    Life, love, and joy still gliding through, 
    And watering our divine abode. 

    4.
    That sacred stream, Thy holy word, 
    Our grief allays, our fear controls; 
    Sweet peace Thy promises afford, 
    And give new strength to fainting souls. 

    5.
    Zion enjoys her Monarch's love, 
    Secure against a threatening hour; 
    Nor can her firm foundation move, 
    Built on His truth, and armed with power.
