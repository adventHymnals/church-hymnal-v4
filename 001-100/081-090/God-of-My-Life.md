[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U11ig3hfMi2%2DlD9%2DW6WKoufdMXqBGUQ0/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    God of my life, whose gracious power 
    Through varied scenes my soul hath led, 
    Or turned aside the fatal hour, 
    Or lifted up my sinking head. 

    2.
    In all my ways Thy hand I own, 
    Thy ruling providence I see: 
    Assist me still my course to run, 
    And still direct my paths to thee. 

    3.
    How do Thy mercies close me round! 
    Forever be Thy name adored; 
    I blush in all things to abound; 
    The servant of a gracious Lord. 

    4.
    I rest beneath Thy kindly shade; 
    My griefs expire, my troubles cease; 
    Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed, 
    Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.
