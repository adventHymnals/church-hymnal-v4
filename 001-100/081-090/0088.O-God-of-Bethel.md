    1.
    O God of Bethel, by whose hand 
    Thy people still are fed, 
    Who through this weary pilgrimage 
    Hast all our fathers led. 

    2.
    Our vows, our prayers, we now present 
    Before Thy throne of grace; 
    God of our fathers, be the God 
    Of their succeeding race. 

    3.
    Through each perplexing path of life 
    Our wandering footsteps guide; 
    Give us each day our daily bread, 
    And raiment fit provide. 

    4.
    O spread Thy covering wings around, 
    Till all our wanderings cease, 
    And at our Father's loved abode 
    We find at last Thy peace.
