## 82.  Beneath Thy Wing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TeZHA2TOl%2DMVzgon9eUXnDDdP3Yybvpr/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    Beneath Thy wing, O God, I rest, 
    Under Thy shadow safely lie, 
    By Thine own strength in peace possest, 
    While dreaded evils pass me by. 

    2.
    With strong desire, I here can stay 
    To see Thy love its work complete; 
    Here can I wait a long delay, 
    Reposing at my Saviour's feet. 

    3.
    My place of lowly service, too, 
    Beneath that sheltering wing I see; 
    For all the work I have to do, 
    Is done through strengthening trust in Thee. 

    4.
    In faith and patience is repose, 
    In faith and rest my strength shall be; 
    And, when Thy joy the Church o'erflows, 
    I know that it will visit me.
