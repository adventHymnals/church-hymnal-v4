    1.
    Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! 
    Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; 
    Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty! 
    ==God over all who rules eternity!==

    2.
    Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee, 
    Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; 
    Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee, 
    Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be. 

    3.
    Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee, 
    Though the eye of man Thy great glory may not see; 
    Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, 
    Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
