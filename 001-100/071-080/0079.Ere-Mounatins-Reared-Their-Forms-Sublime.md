    1.
    Ere mountains reared their forms sublime, 
    Or heaven and earth in order stood, 
    Before the birth of ancient time, 
    From everlasting Thou art God. 

    2.
    A thousand years are in their flight, 
    With Thee but as a fleeting day; 
    Past, present, future, to Thy sight 
    At once their various scenes display. 

    3.
    But our brief life's a shadowy dream, 
    A passing thought that soon is o'er, 
    That fades with morning's earliest beam, 
    And fills the musing mind no more. 

    4.
    To us, O Lord, the wisdom give 
    Each passing moment so to spend, 
    That we at length with Thee may live 
    Where life and bliss shall never end.
