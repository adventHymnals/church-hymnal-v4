## 408. LORD, THY CHILDREN GUIDE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Lord, Thy children guide and keep, 
As with feeble steps they press, 
On the pathway rough and steep, 
Through this weary wilderness: 
Holy Jesus, day by day 
Lead us in the narrow way. 

2.
There are sandy wastes that lie 
Cold and sunless, vast and drear, 
Where the feeble faint and die; 
Grant us grace to persevere. 
Holy Jesus, day by day 
Lead us in the narrow way. 

3.
There are soft and flowery glades 
Decked with golden fruited trees, 
Sunny slopes and scented shades; 
Keep us, Lord, from slothful ease; 
Holy Jesus, day by day 
Lead us in the narrow way. 

4.
Upward still to purer heights, 
Onward yet to scenes more blest, 
Calmer regions, clearer lights, 
Till we reach the promised rest; 
Holy Jesus, day by day 
Lead us in the narrow way.
