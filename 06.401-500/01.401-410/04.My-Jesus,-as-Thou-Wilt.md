## 404. MY JESUS, AS THOU WILT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
My Jesus, as Thou wilt; 
O may Thy will be mine! 
Into Thy hand of love 
I would my all resign. 
Through sorrow or through joy, 
Conduct me as Thine own, 
And help me still to say, 
"My Lord, Thy will be done." 

2.
My Jesus, as Thou wilt; 
Though seen through many a tear, 
Let not my star of hope 
Grow dim or disappear. 
Since Thou on earth hast wept 
And sorrowed oft alone, 
If I must weep with Thee, 
"My Lord, Thy will be done." 

3.
My Jesus, as Thou wilt; 
All shall be well for me; 
Each changing future scene 
I gladly trust with Thee. 
Straight to my home above, 
I travel calmly on, 
And sing in life or death, 
"My Lord, Thy will be done."
