## 456. ANOTHER SIX DAYS' WORK IS DONE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Another six days' work is done, 
Another Sabbath is begun; 
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest, 
Improve the day that God has blessed. 

2.
Come, bless the Lord, whose love as signs 
So sweet a rest to weary minds; 
A blessed antepast is given, 
On this day more than all the seven. 

3.
O that our thoughts and thanks may rise 
As grateful incense to the skies, 
And draw from Christ that sweet repose 
Which none but he who feels it knows. 

4.
This heavenly calm within the breast 
Is the best pledge of glorious rest, 
Which for the church of God remains, 
The end of cares, the end of pains.
