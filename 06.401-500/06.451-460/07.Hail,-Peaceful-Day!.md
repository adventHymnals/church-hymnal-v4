####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Hail, peaceful day! divinely blest! 
Sweetly thy glories would we sing, 
Memorial of that sacred rest, 
Of vast creation's mighty King; 
This hallowed time to man was given, 
A foretaste of the bliss of heaven. 

2.
Hark! through the shining courts above 
What rapturous praises echo now 
Around that holy law of love 
Seraphs in adoration bow; 
Let earth, responsive to the strain, 
Exalt alone Jehovah's name 

3.
O come, thou bright, immortal day! 
When at His temple all adore, 
And own His universal sway 
From age to age, forevermore; 
Then Zion shall in triumph reign, 
And Eden bloom on earth again.
