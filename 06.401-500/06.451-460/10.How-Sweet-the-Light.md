#### Advent Hymnals
## 460. HOW SWEET THE LIGHT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
How sweet the light of Sabbath eve! 
How soft the sunbeams lingering there! 
For these blest hours the world I leave, 
Wafted on wings of faith and prayer. 

2.
Season of rest! the tranquil soul 
Feels the sweet calm, and melts in love; 
And while these sacred moments roll, 
Faith sees a smiling heaven above. 

3.
Nor will our days of toil be long; 
Our pilgrimage will soon be trod; 
And we shall join the ceaseless song, 
The endless Sabbath of our God.
