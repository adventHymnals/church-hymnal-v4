## 435. O WHERE ARE KINGS
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
O where are kings and empires now 
Of old that went and came? 
But, Lord, Thy church is praying yet, 
A thousand years the same. 

2.
We mark her goodly battlements, 
And her foundations strong; 
We hear within the solemn voice 
Of her unending song. 

3.
For not like kingdoms of the world 
Thy holy church, 0 God; 
Though earthquake shocks are threatening her, 
And tempests are abroad; 

4.
Unshaken as eternal hills, 
Immovable she stands, 
A mountain that shall fill the earth, 
A house not made by hands.
