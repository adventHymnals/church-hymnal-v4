## 420. JESUS, FRIEND OF LITTLE CHILDREN
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Jesus, Friend of little children, 
Be a friend to me; 
Take my hand and ever keep me 
Close to Thee. 

2.
Teach me how to grow in goodness, 
Daily as I grow; 
Thou hast been a child, and surely 
Thou dost know. 

3.
Step by step, O, lead me onward, 
Upward into youth; 
Wiser, stronger, still becoming 
In Thy truth. 

4.
Never leave me, nor forsake me; 
Ever be my friend; 
For I need Thee from life's dawning 
To its end.

```
