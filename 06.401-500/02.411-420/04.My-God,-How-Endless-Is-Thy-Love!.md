#### Advent Hymnals
## 414. MY GOD, HOW ENDLESS IS THY LOVE!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
My God, how endless is Thy love! 
Thy gifts are every evening new; 
And morning mercies from above. 
Gently distill like early dew. 

2.
Thou spreadest the curtains of the night, 
Great Guardian of my sleeping hours; 
Thy sovereign word restores the light, 
And quickens all my drowsy powers. 

3.
I yield myself to Thy command; 
To Thee I consecrate my days; 
Perpetual blessings from Thy hand 
Demand perpetual songs of praise.

```
