####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
I will early seek the Saviour, 
I will learn of Him each day; 
I will follow in His footsteps, 
I will walk the narrow way. 
Refrain:
For He loves me, yes, He loves me, 
Jesus loves me, this I know. 
Jesus loves me, died to save me, 
This is why I love Him so. 

2.
I will hasten where He bids me, 
I am not too young to go 
In the pathway where He leadeth, 
Not too young His will to know. 

3.
He is standing at the doorway 
Of escape from every sin; 
I will knock, for He has promised, 
He will hear and let me in.
