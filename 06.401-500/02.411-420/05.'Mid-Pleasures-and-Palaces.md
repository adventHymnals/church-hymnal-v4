1.
'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home! 
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, 
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere. 
Refrain:
Home, home, sweet, sweet home! 
Be it ever so humble, 
There's no place like home! 

2.
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain' 
O give me my lowly thatched cottage again; 
The birds singing sweetly, that came at my call; 
Give me, then, that peace of mind dearer than all. 

3.
To us, in despite of the absence of years, 
How sweet the remembrance of home still appears; 
From allurements abroad which but flatter the eye, 
The unsatisfied heart turns and says with a sigh'
