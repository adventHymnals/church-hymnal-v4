####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
Major Key: D

1.
Thy broken body, gracious Lord,
Is shadowed by this broken bread;
The wine which in this cup is poured,
Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

2.
And while we meet together thus,
We show that we are one in Thee;
Thy precious blood was shed for us,
Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!

3.
We have one hope that Thou wilt come,
Thee in the air we wait to see;
When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,
And we shall ever reign with Thee.
