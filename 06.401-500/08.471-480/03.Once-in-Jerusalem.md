## 473. ONCE IN JERUSALEM
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Once in Jerusalem of old 
Our Saviour washed their feet 
Who climbed with Him Judea's hills, 
And roved its valleys sweet. 
With lowly attitude and mien 
To them He bowed the knee, 
Thus showing how love's service blends 
With meek humility. 

2.
But far from that low path of grace 
His people since have trod, 
And erring feet have trampled down 
The ordinance of God. 
Come brothers, sisters, let us raise 
This long-forgotten rite; 
Bow each to each with humble minds, 
And walk in duty's light. 

3.
With holy kiss, with words of love, 
With hearts all kind and true, 
We'll banish thoughts of envious pride, 
As Jesus' friends should do. 
Dear Saviour, help us keep more near 
The good old Bible ways; 
Head, hands, and feet we pray Thee wash, 
That we may speak Thy praise.
