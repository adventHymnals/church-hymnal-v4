## 475. BY CHRIST REDEEMED
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
Major Key: E Flat

1.
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord,
Until He come.

2.
His broken body in our stead Is here,
In this memorial bread;
And so our feeble love is fed,
Until He come.

3.
His fearful drops of agony,
His life blood shed for us we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery,
Until He come.

4.
And thus that dark betrayal night,
With the last advent unite----
The shame, the glory, by this rite,
Until He come.
