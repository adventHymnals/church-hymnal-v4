## 488. I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Lives I know that my Redeemer lives; 
He lives, and on the earth shall stand; 
And though to worms my flesh He gives, 
My dust lies numbered in His hand. 

2.
In this reanimated clay 
I surely shall behold Him near, 
Shall see Him in the latter day 
In all His majesty appear. 

3.
With mine and not another's eyes 
The King in beauty I shall view; 
I shall from Him receive the prize, 
The starry crown to victors due. 

```
