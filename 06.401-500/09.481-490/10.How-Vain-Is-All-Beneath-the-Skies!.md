## 490. HOW VAIN IS ALL BENEATH THE SKIES!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
How vain is all beneath the skies! 
How transient every earthly bliss! 
How slender all the fondest ties 
That bind us to a world like this! 

2.
The evening cloud, the morning dew, 
The withering grass, the fading flower, 
Of earthly hopes are emblems true' 
The glory of a passing hour. 

3.
But though earth's fairest blossoms die, 
And all beneath the skies is vain, 
There is a land whose confines lie 
Beyond the reach of care and pain. 

4.
Then let the hope of joys to come 
Dispel our cares, and chase our fears; 
If Cod be ours, we're traveling home, 
Though passing through a vale of tears.
