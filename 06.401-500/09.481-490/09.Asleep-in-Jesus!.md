## 489. ASLEEP IN JESUS!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep, 
From which none ever wake to weep; 
A calm and undisturbed repose, 
Unbroken by the last of foes. 

2.
Asleep in Jesus! 0 how sweet 
To be for such a slumber meet! 
With holy confidence to rest 
In hope of being ever blest. 

3.
Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest, 
Whose waking is supremely blest; 
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour 
That manifests the Saviour's power. 

4.
Asleep in Jesus! Soon to rise, 
When the last trump shall rend the skies; 
Then burst the fetters of the tomb, 
And wake in full, immortal bloom.
