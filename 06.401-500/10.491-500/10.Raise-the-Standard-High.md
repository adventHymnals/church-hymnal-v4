#### Advent Hymnals
## 500. RAISE THE STANDARD HIGH
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Raise the standard high, 
Sound the gathering cry, 
Let the evil kingdom fall; 
With a purpose true, 
And a will to do, 
Sons of freedom, come ye all. 
Refrain:
Raise the temperance standard high, 
Shout the mighty battle cry; 
Let the evil kingdom fall, 
Sons of freedom, come ye all. 

2.
Over sea and land 
With an iron hand, 
Has the monarch held his sway; 
But his rule shall cease, 
And the reign of peace 
Usher in the golden day. 

3.
Let the right prevail, 
Let the evil fail 
In the conflict fierce and long, 
'Till the land is free, 
And the victory 
Crowns the temperance army strong.
