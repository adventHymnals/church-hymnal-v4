#### Advent Hymnals
## 497. STANDING BY A PURPOSE TRUE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
 Standing by a purpose true, 
Heeding God's command, 
Honor them, the faithful few, 
All hail to Daniel's band! 
Refrain:
Dare to be a Daniel, 
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm! 
Dare to make it known! 

2.
Many mighty men are lost, 
Daring not to stand, 
Who for God had been a host 
By joining Daniel's band! 

3.
Many giants great and tall, 
Stalking through the land, 
Headlong to the earth would fall 
If met by Daniel's band! 

4.
Hold the temperance banner high! 
On to victory grand! 
Satan and his host defy, 
And shout for Daniel's band!
