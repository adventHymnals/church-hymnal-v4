####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Not now, but in the coming years, 
It may be in the better land, 
We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
And there, sometime, we'll understand. 
Refrain:
Then trust in God through all thy days; 
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise, 
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand. 

2.
We'll catch the broken thread again, 
And finish what we here began; 
Heaven will the mysteries explain, 
And then, ah, then we'll understand. 

3.
We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
Were over many a cherished plan; 
Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
'Tis there, sometime, we'll understand. 

4.
Why what we long for most of all, 
Eludes so oft our eager hand; 
Why hopes are crushed and castles fall, 
Up there, sometime, we'll understand. 

5.
God knows the way, He holds the key, 
He guides us with unerring hand; 
Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see; 
Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.
