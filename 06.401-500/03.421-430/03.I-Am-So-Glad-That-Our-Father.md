####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
I am so glad that our Father in heaven 
Tells of His love in the Book He has given, 
Wonderful things in the Bible I see; 
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me. 
Refrain:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
Jesus loves even me. 

2.
Though I forget Him and wander away, 
Still He doth love me wherever I stray; 
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, 
When I remember that Jesus loves me. 

3.
O, if there's only one song I can sing, 
When in His beauty I see the great King, 
This shall my song in eternity be: " 
O, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."
