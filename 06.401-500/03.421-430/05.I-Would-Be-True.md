#### Advent Hymnals
## 425. I WOULD BE TRUE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
I would be true, for there are those who trust me; 
I would be pure, for there are those who care; 
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer; 
I would be brave, for there is much to dare; 
I would be brave, for there is much to dare. 

2.
I would be friend of all'the foe, the friendless; 
I would be giving, and forget the gift; 
I would be humble, for I know my weakness; 
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift; 
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift. 

3.
I would be learning, day by day, the lessons 
My heavenly Father gives me in His word; 
I would be quick to hear His lightest whisper, 
And prompt and glad to do the things I've heard; 
And prompt and glad to do the things I've heard.
