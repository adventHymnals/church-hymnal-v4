## 421. ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
Refrain:
All things bright and beautiful 
All creatures great and small 
All things wise and wonderful 
The Lord God made them all. 

1.
Each little flower that opens, 
Each little bird that sings; 
He made their glowing colors, 
He made their tiny wings. 

2.
The purple-headed mountain 
The river running by, 
The sunset, and the morning 
That brighten up the sky. 

3.
The cold wind in the winter, 
The pleasant summer sun, 
The ripe fruits in the garden, 
He made them, every one. 

4.
He gave us eyes to see them, 
And lips that we might tell 
How great is God Almighty, 
Who has made all things well.

```
