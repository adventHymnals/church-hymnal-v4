####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Hushed was the evening hymn, 
The temple courts were dark, 
The lamp was burning dim 
Before the sacred ark, 
When suddenly a voice divine 
Rang through the silence of the shrine. 

2.
O give me Samuel's ear. 
The open ear, O Lord, 
Alive and quick to hear 
Each whisper of Thy word! 
Like him to answer at Thy call 
And to obey Thee first of all. 

3.
O give me Samuel's heart, 
A lowly heart, that waits 
Where in Thy house Thou art, 
Or watches at Thy gates! 
By day and night, a heart that still 
Moves at the breathing of Thy will. 

4.
O give me Samuel's mind, 
A sweet, unmurmuring faith, 
Obedient and resigned 
To Thee in life and death! 
That I may read with childlike eyes 
Truths that are hidden from the wise.
