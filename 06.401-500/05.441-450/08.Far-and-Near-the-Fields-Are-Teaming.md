        Church Hymnal 1941 448. Far and Near the Fields Are Teaming. Far and near the fields are teeming With the sheaves of ripened grain; Far and near their gold is gleaming O'er the sunny slope and plain. CHORUS: Lord of harvest, send forth reapers! Hear us Lord, to Thee we cry; Send them now the sheaves to gather, Ere the harvest-time pass by.

Major Key: F

1.
Far and near the fields are teeming
With the sheaves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O'er the sunny slope and plain.
CHORUS:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord, to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.

2.
Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
Send them in the noon-tides's glare;
When the sun's last rays are streaming,
Bid them gather everywhere.

3.
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
Gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.
