    1.
    The church has one foundation
    Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
    She is His new creation
    By water and the Word.
    From heaven He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride;
    With His own blood He bought her,
    And for her life He died. 

    2.
    Elect from every nation,
    Yet one o'er all the earth;
    Her charter of salvation,
    One Lord, one faith, one birth;
    One holy name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With every grace endued.

    3.
    Though with a scornful wonder
    We see her sore oppressed,
    By schisms rent asunder,
    By heresies distressed,
    Yet saints their watch are keeping;
    Their cry goes up, How long?
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.

    4.
    'Mid toil and tribulation,
    And tumult of her war,
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace forevermore;
    Till, with the vision glorious,
    Her longing eyes are blest,
    And the great church victorious
    Shall be the church at rest.
