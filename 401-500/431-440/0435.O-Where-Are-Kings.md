[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0AN_P4ae8sV_cqWAjvbfUi6F_d0VR9s/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O where are kings and empires now 
    Of old that went and came? 
    But, Lord, Thy church is praying yet, 
    A thousand years the same. 

    2.
    We mark her goodly battlements, 
    And her foundations strong; 
    We hear within the solemn voice 
    Of her unending song. 

    3.
    For not like kingdoms of the world 
    Thy holy church, 0 God; 
    Though earthquake shocks are threatening her, 
    And tempests are abroad; 

    4.
    Unshaken as eternal hills, 
    Immovable she stands, 
    A mountain that shall fill the earth, 
    A house not made by hands.
