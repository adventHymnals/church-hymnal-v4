    1.
    In Christ there is no east nor west,
    In Him no south or north;
    But one great fellowship of love
    Throughout the whole wide earth.

    2.
    In Him shall true heart everywhere
    Their high communion find;
    His service is the golden cord
    Close binding all mankind.

    3.
    Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
    Whate'er your race may be.
    Who serves my Father as a son
    Is surely kin to me.

    4.
    In Christ now meet both east and west,
    In Him meet south and north;
    All Christly souls are one in Him
    Throughout the whole wide earth.
