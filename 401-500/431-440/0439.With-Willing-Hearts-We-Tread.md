[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_L25xwvXi1anA4F6pBkkV4GEhgtNMXXR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With willing hearts we tread 
    The path the Saviour trod; 
    We love th'example of our head, 
    The glorious Lamb of God. 

    2.
    On Thee, on Thee alone, 
    Our hope and faith rely, 
    O Thou who wilt for sin atone, 
    Who didst for sinners die! 

    3.
    We trust Thy sacrifice, 
    To Thy dear cross we flee; 
    O may we die to sin, and rise 
    To life and bliss in Thee.
