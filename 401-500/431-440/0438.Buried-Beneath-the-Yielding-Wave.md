    1.
    Buried beneath the yielding wave 
    The great Redeemer lies; 
    Faith views Him in the watery grave, 
    And hence beholds Him rise. 

    2.
    Thus do these willing souls today 
    Their ardent zeal express, 
    And in the Lord's appointed way 
    Fulfill all righteousness. 

    3.
    With joy we in His footsteps tread, 
    And would His cause maintain; 
    Like Him be numbered with the dead, 
    And with Him rise and reign. 

    4.
    His presence oft revives our hearts, 
    And drives our fears away; 
    When He commands, and strength imparts, 
    We cheerfully obey.
