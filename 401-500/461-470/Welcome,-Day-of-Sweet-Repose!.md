    1.
    Welcome, day of sweet repose!
    Blessed be thy sacred hours!
    We would trust the One who knows
    All our weak and failing powers.

    2.
    Welcome, day in Eden born!
    Holy rest for sinless man!
    Like the dawning of fair morn
    Come thy hours to us again.

    3.
    Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!
    Toil shall cease and anxious care.
    Day commanded by His word,
    Day for song and praise and prayer.

    4.
    Welcome, day our Savior kept!
    Keeping, wrought our righteousness,
    Day God bids us ne'er forget,
    Day of days His name to bless.
