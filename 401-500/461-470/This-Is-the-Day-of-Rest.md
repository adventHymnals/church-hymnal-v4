    1.
    This is the day of rest; 
    Our failing strength renew; 
    On weary brain and troubled breast 
    Shed Thou Thy freshening dew. 

    2.
    This is the day of peace; 
    Thy peace our spirits fill; 
    Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease, 
    The waves of strife be still. 

    3.
    This is the day of prayer; 
    Let earth to heaven draw near; 
    Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there; 
    Come down to meet us here. 

    4.
    This is the best of days; 
    Send forth Thy quickening breath, 
    And wake dead souls to love and praise, 
    O Vanquisher of death!
