    Major Key: E Flat

    1.
    O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright,
    On thee the high and lowly
    Who bend before the throne
    Sing, Holy, holy, holy,
    To the Eternal One.

    2.
    Thou art a port protected
    From storms that round us rise;
    A garden intersected
    With streams of paradise;
    Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life's dry dreary sand;
    From Thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
    We view our promised land.

    3.
    A day of sweet reflection
    Thou art, a day of love,
    A day to raise affection
    From earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We seek the rest remaining
    In mansions of the blest.
