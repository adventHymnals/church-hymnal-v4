[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YskM_vpnyCaeYLn4rt1z6OSmASd0W9kF/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I am so glad that our Father in heaven 
    Tells of His love in the Book He has given, 
    Wonderful things in the Bible I see; 
    This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me. 
    Refrain:
    I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
    Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, 
    I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
    Jesus loves even me. 

    2.
    Though I forget Him and wander away, 
    Still He doth love me wherever I stray; 
    Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, 
    When I remember that Jesus loves me. 

    3.
    O, if there's only one song I can sing, 
    When in His beauty I see the great King, 
    This shall my song in eternity be: " 
    O, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."
