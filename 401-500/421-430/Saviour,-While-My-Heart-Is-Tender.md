[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z%2DlkBFNEmH4a1t7o6SgmJulYlfIo3euf/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saviour, while my heart is tender, 
    I would yield that heart to Thee; 
    All my powers to Thee surrender, 
    Thine, and only Thine, to be. 

    2.
    Take me now, Lord Jesus, take me, 
    Let my youthful heart be Thine; 
    Thy devoted servant make me, 
    Fill my soul with love divine. 

    3.
    Send me, Lord, where Thou wilt send me, 
    Only do Thou guide my way; 
    May Thy grace through life attend me; 
    Gladly then shall I obey.
