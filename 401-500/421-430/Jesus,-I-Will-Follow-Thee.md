    1.
    Jesus, I will follow Thee, 
    For I hear Thee calling me; 
    Loving, trusting, glad I come, 
    To let Thee lead me home. 
    Refrain:
    I will follow Thee, 
    I will follow Thee, 
    I will follow Thee, 
    Wherever Thou dost lead. 

    2.
    Little eyes might lose the way, 
    Little feet might go astray; 
    I might weak and weary be, 
    But Thou art strong for me. 

    3.
    Grief and want may be my foes, 
    Foolish sins my way oppose; 
    Full of courage I will be, 
    Whene'er I follow Thee.
