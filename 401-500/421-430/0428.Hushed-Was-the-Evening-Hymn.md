    1.
    Hushed was the evening hymn, 
    The temple courts were dark, 
    The lamp was burning dim 
    Before the sacred ark, 
    When suddenly a voice divine 
    Rang through the silence of the shrine. 

    2.
    O give me Samuel's ear. 
    The open ear, O Lord, 
    Alive and quick to hear 
    Each whisper of Thy word! 
    Like him to answer at Thy call 
    And to obey Thee first of all. 

    3.
    O give me Samuel's heart, 
    A lowly heart, that waits 
    Where in Thy house Thou art, 
    Or watches at Thy gates! 
    By day and night, a heart that still 
    Moves at the breathing of Thy will. 

    4.
    O give me Samuel's mind, 
    A sweet, unmurmuring faith, 
    Obedient and resigned 
    To Thee in life and death! 
    That I may read with childlike eyes 
    Truths that are hidden from the wise.
