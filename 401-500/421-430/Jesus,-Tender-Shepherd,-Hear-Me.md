    1.
    Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
    Bless Thy little lamb tonight;
    Through the darkness be Thou near me;
    Watch my sleep till morning light.

    2.
    All this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care;
    Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
    Listen to my evening prayer.
