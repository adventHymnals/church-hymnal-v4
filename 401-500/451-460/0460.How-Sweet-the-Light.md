    1.
    How sweet the light of Sabbath eve! 
    How soft the sunbeams lingering there! 
    For these blest hours the world I leave, 
    Wafted on wings of faith and prayer. 

    2.
    Season of rest! the tranquil soul 
    Feels the sweet calm, and melts in love; 
    And while these sacred moments roll, 
    Faith sees a smiling heaven above. 

    3.
    Nor will our days of toil be long; 
    Our pilgrimage will soon be trod; 
    And we shall join the ceaseless song, 
    The endless Sabbath of our God.
