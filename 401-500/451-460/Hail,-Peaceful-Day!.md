    1.
    Hail, peaceful day! divinely blest! 
    Sweetly thy glories would we sing, 
    Memorial of that sacred rest, 
    Of vast creation's mighty King; 
    This hallowed time to man was given, 
    A foretaste of the bliss of heaven. 

    2.
    Hark! through the shining courts above 
    What rapturous praises echo now 
    Around that holy law of love 
    Seraphs in adoration bow; 
    Let earth, responsive to the strain, 
    Exalt alone Jehovah's name 

    3.
    O come, thou bright, immortal day! 
    When at His temple all adore, 
    And own His universal sway 
    From age to age, forevermore; 
    Then Zion shall in triumph reign, 
    And Eden bloom on earth again.
