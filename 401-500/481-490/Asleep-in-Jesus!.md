    1.
    Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep, 
    From which none ever wake to weep; 
    A calm and undisturbed repose, 
    Unbroken by the last of foes. 

    2.
    Asleep in Jesus! 0 how sweet 
    To be for such a slumber meet! 
    With holy confidence to rest 
    In hope of being ever blest. 

    3.
    Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest, 
    Whose waking is supremely blest; 
    No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour 
    That manifests the Saviour's power. 

    4.
    Asleep in Jesus! Soon to rise, 
    When the last trump shall rend the skies; 
    Then burst the fetters of the tomb, 
    And wake in full, immortal bloom.
