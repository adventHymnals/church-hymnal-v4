    1.
    Great King of glory, come, 
    And with Thy favor crown 
    This temple as Thy home, 
    This people as Thine own; 
    Beneath this roof, 0 deign to show 
    How God can dwell with men below. 

    2.
    Here may Thine ears attend 
    Our interceding cries, 
    And grateful praise ascend, 
    Like incense, to the skies; 
    Here may Thy word melodious sound, 
    And spread celestial joys around. 

    3.
    Here may our unborn sons 
    And daughters sound Thy praise, 
    And shine, like polished stones, 
    Through long-succeeding days; 
    Here, Lord, display Thy saving power, 
    While temples stand and men adore. 

    4.
    Here may the listening throng 
    Receive Thy truth in love; 
    Here Christians join the song 
    Of seraphim above, 
    Till all, who humbly seek Thy face, 
    Rejoice in Thy abounding grace.
