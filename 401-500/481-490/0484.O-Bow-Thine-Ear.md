[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a48gSv1TC59zYIYQUVKW_KHOSKHBaqLL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O bow Thine ear, Eternal One! 
    On Thee each heart adoring calls; 
    To Thee the followers of Thy Son 
    Have raised, and now devote, these walls. 

    2.
    Here let Thy holy days be kept; 
    And be this place to worship given, 
    Like that bright spot where Jacob slept, 
    The house of God, the gate of heaven. 

    3.
    Here may Thine honor dwell; and here 
    As incense, let Thy children's prayer, 
    From contrite hearts and lips sincere, 
    Rise on the still and holy air. 

    4.
    Here be Thy praise devoutly sung, 
    Here let Thy truth beam forth to save 
    As when of old Thy Spirit hung 
    On wings of light o'er Jordan's wave.
