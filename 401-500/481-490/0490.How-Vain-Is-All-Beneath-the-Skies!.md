    1.
    How vain is all beneath the skies! 
    How transient every earthly bliss! 
    How slender all the fondest ties 
    That bind us to a world like this! 

    2.
    The evening cloud, the morning dew, 
    The withering grass, the fading flower, 
    Of earthly hopes are emblems true' 
    The glory of a passing hour. 

    3.
    But though earth's fairest blossoms die, 
    And all beneath the skies is vain, 
    There is a land whose confines lie 
    Beyond the reach of care and pain. 

    4.
    Then let the hope of joys to come 
    Dispel our cares, and chase our fears; 
    If Cod be ours, we're traveling home, 
    Though passing through a vale of tears.
