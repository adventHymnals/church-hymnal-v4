    1.
    Lives I know that my Redeemer lives; 
    He lives, and on the earth shall stand; 
    And though to worms my flesh He gives, 
    My dust lies numbered in His hand. 

    2.
    In this reanimated clay 
    I surely shall behold Him near, 
    Shall see Him in the latter day 
    In all His majesty appear. 

    3.
    With mine and not another's eyes 
    The King in beauty I shall view; 
    I shall from Him receive the prize, 
    The starry crown to victors due.
