    1.
    Would you win a Saviour's blessing? 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Would you see His work progressing? 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Let your souls with love expand, 
    Open wide a liberal hand; 
    Would you follow God's command? 
    Freely, freely give. 

    2.
    With a cheerful heart and willing, 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Like the dew its balm distilling, 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Have you little? Give your mite; 
    O how precious in His sight! 
    He your offering will requite; 
    Freely, freely give. 

    3.
    Give to spread the grand old story, 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Give to speed the light of glory. 
    Freely, freely give; 
    Would you gain a rich reward 
    In the harvest of the Lord, 
    Then obedient to His word. 
    Freely, freely give.
