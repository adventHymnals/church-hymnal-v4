    1.
    A year of precious blessings, 
    And glorious victories won, 
    Of earnest work progressing, 
    Its onward course has run; 
    To Thee, O God, our Refuge, 
    Whose goodness crowns our days, 
    Within Thy earthly temple 
    We lift our souls in praise; 
    Within Thy earthly temple 
    We lift our souls in praise. 

    2.
    Thou Master of assemblies, 
    In mighty power descend, 
    Behold our glad reunion, 
    Conduct it to the end; 
    Inspire our hearts with courage, 
    And deeper love for Thee, 
    That all Thy name may honor, 
    Where'er our field may be; 
    That all Thy name may honor, 
    Where'er our field may be. 

    3.
    O church of God's Anointed, 
    March on the lost to win, 
    Lead forth Thy ranks victorious 
    Against the hosts of sin; 
    'Till at His throne in glory, 
    Where angels prostrate fall, 
    One hallelujah chorus 
    Shall crown Him Lord of all; 
    One hallelujah chorus 
    Shall crown Him Lord of all.
