    Major Key: G
    We give Thee but Thine own,
    What-e'er the gift may be;
    All that we have is Thine alone,
    A trust, O Lord, from Thee.
    May we Thy bounties thus As stewards true receive,
    And gladly, as Thou blessest us,
    To Thee our first fruits give.
    O hearts are bruised and dead,
    And homes are bare and cold,
    And lambs for whom the Shepherd
    bled Are straying from the fold.
    And we believe Thy word, Though dim our faith may be;
    Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,We do it unto Thee.
