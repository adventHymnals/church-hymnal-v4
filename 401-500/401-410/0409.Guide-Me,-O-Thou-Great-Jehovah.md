    Major Key: G

    1.
    Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
    Pilgrim through this barren land.
    I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
    Hold me with Thy powerful hand.
    Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
    Feed me till I want no more;
    Feed me till I want no more.

    2.
    Open now the crystal fountain,
    Whence the healing stream doth flow;
    Let the fire and cloudy pillar
    Lead me all my journey through.
    Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
    Be Thou still my strength and shield;
    Be Thou still my strength and shield.

    3.
    When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Death of death and hell's destruction,
    Land me safe on Canaan's side.
    Songs of praises, songs of praises,
    I will ever give to Thee;
    I will ever give to Thee.
