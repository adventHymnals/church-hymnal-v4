    Major Key: G

    1.
    Lord, speak to me, that I may speak 
    In living echoes of Thy tone; 
    As Thou has sought, so let me seek 
    Thine erring children lost and lone. 

    2.
    O lead me, Lord, that I may lead 
    The wandering and the wavering feet;
    O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
    Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

    3.
    O strengthen me, that while I stand 
    Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee, 
    I may stretch out a loving land 
    To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
