    1.
    My God, how endless is Thy love! 
    Thy gifts are every evening new; 
    And morning mercies from above. 
    Gently distill like early dew. 

    2.
    Thou spreadest the curtains of the night, 
    Great Guardian of my sleeping hours; 
    Thy sovereign word restores the light, 
    And quickens all my drowsy powers. 

    3.
    I yield myself to Thy command; 
    To Thee I consecrate my days; 
    Perpetual blessings from Thy hand 
    Demand perpetual songs of praise.
