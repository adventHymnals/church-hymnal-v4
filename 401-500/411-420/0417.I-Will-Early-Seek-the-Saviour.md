    1.
    I will early seek the Saviour, 
    I will learn of Him each day; 
    I will follow in His footsteps, 
    I will walk the narrow way. 
    Refrain:
    For He loves me, yes, He loves me, 
    Jesus loves me, this I know. 
    Jesus loves me, died to save me, 
    This is why I love Him so. 

    2.
    I will hasten where He bids me, 
    I am not too young to go 
    In the pathway where He leadeth, 
    Not too young His will to know. 

    3.
    He is standing at the doorway 
    Of escape from every sin; 
    I will knock, for He has promised, 
    He will hear and let me in.
