[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1algwq6tfiXH2%2DFuLmDoFEparS7gmXxhP/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Happy the home when God is there, 
    And love fills every breast; 
    When one their wish, and one their prayer, 
    And one their heavenly rest. 

    2.
    Happy the home where Jesus' name 
    Is sweet to every ear; 
    Where children early speak his fame, 
    And parents hold him dear. 

    3.
    Happy the home where prayer is heard, 
    And praise is wont to rise; 
    Where parents love the sacred Word 
    And all its wisdom prize. 

    4.
    Lord, let us in our homes agree 
    This blessed peace to gain; 
    Unite our hearts in love to thee, 
    And love to all will reign.
