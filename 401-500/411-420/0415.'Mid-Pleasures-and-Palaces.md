    1.
    'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home! 
    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, 
    Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere. 
    Refrain:
    Home, home, sweet, sweet home! 
    Be it ever so humble, 
    There's no place like home! 

    2.
    An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain' 
    O give me my lowly thatched cottage again; 
    The birds singing sweetly, that came at my call; 
    Give me, then, that peace of mind dearer than all. 

    3.
    To us, in despite of the absence of years, 
    How sweet the remembrance of home still appears; 
    From allurements abroad which but flatter the eye, 
    The unsatisfied heart turns and says with a sigh'
