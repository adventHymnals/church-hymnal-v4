[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b9WaMywTXWOCe%2DkOrT%2DTIgXVfYYsu5p6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In our hearts celestial voices 
    Softly say: 
    "Day is passing, night is coming; 
    Kneel and pray," 

    2.
    Father, we obey the summons; 
    Hear Our cry; 
    Pity us and help our weakness, 
    Thou Most High. 

    3.
    For the joys that most we cherish 
    Praised be Thou! 
    Good and gentle art Thou ever; 
    Hear us now. 

    4.
    Coming morrows we may never 
    Live to see; 
    All we ask Thee is to keep us, 
    Safe with Thee. 

    5.
    We are only little children 
    Kneeling here, 
    And we want our loving Father 
    Always near. 

    6.
    Take us in Thy arms and keep us 
    As Thine own; 
    Gather us like little sunbeams 
    Round Thy throne.
