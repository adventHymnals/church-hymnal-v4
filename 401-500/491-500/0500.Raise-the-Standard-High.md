    1.
    Raise the standard high, 
    Sound the gathering cry, 
    Let the evil kingdom fall; 
    With a purpose true, 
    And a will to do, 
    Sons of freedom, come ye all. 
    Refrain:
    Raise the temperance standard high, 
    Shout the mighty battle cry; 
    Let the evil kingdom fall, 
    Sons of freedom, come ye all. 

    2.
    Over sea and land 
    With an iron hand, 
    Has the monarch held his sway; 
    But his rule shall cease, 
    And the reign of peace 
    Usher in the golden day. 

    3.
    Let the right prevail, 
    Let the evil fail 
    In the conflict fierce and long, 
    'Till the land is free, 
    And the victory 
    Crowns the temperance army strong.
