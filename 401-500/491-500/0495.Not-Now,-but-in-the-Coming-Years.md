    1.
    Not now, but in the coming years, 
    It may be in the better land, 
    We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
    And there, sometime, we'll understand. 
    Refrain:
    Then trust in God through all thy days; 
    Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
    Though dark thy way, still sing and praise, 
    Sometime, sometime, we'll understand. 

    2.
    We'll catch the broken thread again, 
    And finish what we here began; 
    Heaven will the mysteries explain, 
    And then, ah, then we'll understand. 

    3.
    We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
    Were over many a cherished plan; 
    Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
    'Tis there, sometime, we'll understand. 

    4.
    Why what we long for most of all, 
    Eludes so oft our eager hand; 
    Why hopes are crushed and castles fall, 
    Up there, sometime, we'll understand. 

    5.
    God knows the way, He holds the key, 
    He guides us with unerring hand; 
    Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see; 
    Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.
