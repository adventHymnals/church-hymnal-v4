    1.
    Sound the battle cry,
    See! the foe is nigh;
    Raise the standard high
    For the Lord;
    Gird your armor on,
    Stand firm, every one,
    Rest your cause upon His holy word.
    CHORUS:
    Rouse, then soldiers!
    Rally round the banner!
    Ready, steady, pass the word along;
    Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
    Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

    2.
    Strong to meet the foe,
    Marching on we go,
    While our cause we know
    Must prevail;
    Shield and banner bright,
    Gleaming in the light,
    Battling for the right,
    We ne'er can fail.

    3.
    O Thou God of all,
    Hear us when we call,
    Help us, one and all,
    By Thy grace;
    When the battleï¿½s done,
    And the victory won,
    May we wear the crown
    Before Thy face.
