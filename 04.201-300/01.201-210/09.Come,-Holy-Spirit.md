## 209. COME, HOLY SPIRIT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 
With all thy quickening powers; 
Kindle a flame of sacred love 
In these cold hearts of ours. 

2.
O raise our thoughts from things below, 
From vanities and toys! 
Then shall we with fresh courage go 
To reach eternal joys. 

3.
Awake our souls to joyful songs; 
Let pure devotion rise; 
Till praise employs our thankful tongues, 
And doubt forever dies. 

4.
Father, we would no longer live 
At this poor, dying rate; 
To thee our tankful love we give, 
For thine to us is great. 

5.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 
With all thy quickening powers; 
Come, shed abroad the Saviour's love 
And that shall kindle ours.
