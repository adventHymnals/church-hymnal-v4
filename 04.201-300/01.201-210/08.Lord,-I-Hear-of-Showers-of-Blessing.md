```txt

1.
Lord, I hear of showers of blessing, 
Thou art scattering full and free; 
Showers, the thirsty soul refreshing; 
Let some drops now fall on me, 
Even me, even me, 
Let some drops now fall on me. 

2.
Pass me not, O gracious Father! 
Sinful though my heart may be; 
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather 
Let thy mercy rest on me. 
Even me, even me, 
Let some drops now fall on me. 

3.
Have I long in sin been sleeping? 
Long been slighting, grieving, thee? 
Has the world my heart been keeping? 
O forgive and rescue me! 
Even me, even me, 
Let some drops now fall on me. 

4.
Pass me not, O Holy Spirit! 
Thou canst make the blind to see; 
Testify of Jesus' merit, 
Speak the word of peace to me. 
Even me, even me, 
Let some drops now fall on me.
