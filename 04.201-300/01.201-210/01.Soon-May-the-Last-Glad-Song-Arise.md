## 201. SOON MAY THE LAST GLAD SONG ARISE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Soon may the last glad song arise 
Through all the millions of the skies; 
That song of triumph which records 
That all the earth is now the Lord's. 

2.
Let thrones and powers and kingdoms be 
Obedient, mighty God, to Thee; 
And over land and stream and main 
Wave Thou the scepter of Thy reign. 

3.
O let the anthem now might swell, 
And host to host the triumph tell, 
Till not one rebel heart remains, 
But over all the Savior reigns!
