####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour, 
Come and bid our doubtings cease; 
Come, O, come with love and favor, 
Fill us all with joy and peace. 

2.
Fearful dangers are around us, 
Satan watches to destroy; 
Lord, our foes would fain confound us; 
O, for us thy might employ! 

3.
On thy word our souls are resting; 
Taught by thee, thy name we love; 
Sweetest of all names is Jesus; 
How it doth our spirits move! 

4.
Let us not, O Lord, be weary 
Of the roughness of the way; 
Though the road be often dreary, 
Thou shalt drive our gloom away.
