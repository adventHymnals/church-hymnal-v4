## 204. COME, GRACIOUS SPIRIT
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Come, gracious Spirit, heav'nly Dove, 
With light and comfort from above; 
Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our Guide; 
O'er all thoughts and step preside. 

2.
To us the light of truth display, 
And make us know and choose thy way; 
Plant holy fear in every heart, 
That we from God may ne'er depart. 

3.
Lead us to holiness'the road 
That we must take to dwell with God; 
Lead us to Christ, the living way, 
Nor let us from his precepts stray. 

4.
Lead us to God, our final rest, 
To be with him forever blest; 
Lead us to heaven, its bliss to share 
Fullness of joy forever there!
