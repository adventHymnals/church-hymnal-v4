        Church Hymnal 1941 299. There Is a Land of Pure Delight.  There is a land of pure delight,  Where saints immortal reign,  Infinite day excludes the night,  And pleasures banish pain.  There everlasting spring abides,  And never withering flowers,  And but a little space divides  This heav'nly land from ours.

####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
There is a land of pure delight, 
Where saints immortal reign, 
Infinite day excludes the night, 
And pleasures banish pain. 
There everlasting spring abides, 
And never withering flowers, 
And but a little space divides 
This heav'nly land from ours. 

2.
O could we make our doubts remove, 
Those gloomy thoughts that rise, 
And see the Canaan that we love, 
With unbeclouded eyes; 
Could we but climb where Moses stood, 
And view the landscape o'er, 
Not all this world's pretended good 
Could ever charm us more.
