Major Key: F

1.
O Jesus, I have promised 
To serve Thee to the end; 
Be Thou forever near me, 
My Master and my Friend. 
I shall not fear the battle 
If Thou art by my side, 
Nor wander from the pathway 
If Thou wilt be my Guide. 

2.
O let me feel Thee near me! 
The world is ever near; 
I see the sights that dazzle, 
The tempting sounds I hear; 
My foes are ever near me, 
Around me and within; 
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, 
And shield my soul from sin. 

3.
O Jesus, Thou hast promised 
To all who follow Thee 
That where Thou art in glory 
There shall Thy servant be. 
And Jesus, I have promised 
To serve Thee to the end; 
O give me grace to follow, 
My Master and my Friend.
