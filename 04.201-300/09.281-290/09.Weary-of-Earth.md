## 289. WEARY OF EARTH
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
Weary of earth and laden with my sin, 
I look to heaven and long to enter in; 
But there no evil thing may find a home, 
And yet I hear a voice that bids me, "Come." 

2.
The while I fain would tread the heavenly way, 
Evil is ever with me day by day; 
Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall, 
"Repent, return; thou shalt be loosed from all." 

3.
Cease, restless will! thy lonely strife resign! 
I know too well how little strength is mine; 
Grant me, dear Lord, Thy saving love to see; 
I strive no more; I give myself to Thee.
