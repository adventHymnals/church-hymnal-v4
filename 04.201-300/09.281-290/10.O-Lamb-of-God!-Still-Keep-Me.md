####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
1.
O Lamb of God! still keep me 
Near to Thy wounded side; 
'Tis only there in safely 
And peace I can abide! 
What foes and snares surround me, 
What doubts and fears within! 
The grace that sought and found me, 
Alone can keep me clean. 

2.
'Tis only in Thee hiding 
I know my life secure' 
Only in Thee abiding, 
The conflict can endure. 
Thine arm the victory gaineth 
O'er every hateful foe; 
Thy love my heart sustaineth 
In all its care and woe. 

3.
Soon shall my eyes behold Thee, 
With rapture, face to face; 
One half hath not been told me 
Of all Thy power and grace. 
Thy beauty, Lord, and glory, 
The wonders of Thy love, 
Shall be the endless story 
Of all the saints above.

```
