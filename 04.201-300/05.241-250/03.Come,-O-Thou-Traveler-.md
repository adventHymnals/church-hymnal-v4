####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Come, O thou Traveler unknown, 
Whom still I hold but cannot see; 
My company before is gone, 
And I am left alone with thee; 
With thee all night I mean to stay, 
And wrestle till the break of day. 

2.
I need not tell thee who I am, 
My sin and misery declare; 
Thyself hast called me by my name, 
Look on thy hands, and read it there; 
But who, I ask thee, who art thou? 
Tell me thy name, and tell me now. 

3.
In vain thou strugglest to get free; 
I never will unloose my hold; 
Art thou the Man that died for me? 
The secret of thy love unfold; 
Clinging, I will not let thee go, 
Till I thy name, thy nature know.
