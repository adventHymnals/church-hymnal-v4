####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
O for a faith that will not shrink, 
Though pressed by many a foe; 
That will not tremble on the brink of poverty, 
Of poverty or woe; 
Of poverty or woe; 

2.
That will not murmur or complain 
Beneath the chastening rod, 
But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain 
Can lean upon its God; 
Can lean upon its God. 

3.
A faith that shines more bright and clear 
When tempests rage without; 
That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear, 
In darkness feels no doubt; 
In darkness feels no doubt. 

4.
That bears unmoved the world's dread frown, 
Nor heeds its scornful smile; 
That sin's wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown, 
Nor its soft arts beguile; 
Nor its soft arts beguile. 

5.
Lord, give me such a faith as this, 
And then, whate'er may come 
I'll taste, e'en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss 
Of an eternal home; 
Of an eternal home.
