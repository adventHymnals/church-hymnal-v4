## 248. 'TIS MY HAPPINESS BELOW
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
'Tis my happiness below 
Not to live without the cross; 
But the Saviour's power to know, 
Sanctifying every loss. 

2.
Trials must and will befall; 
But with humble faith to see 
Love inscribed upon them all' 
This is happiness to me. 

3.
Did I meet no trials here, 
No chastisement by the way, 
Might I not with reason fear 
I should prove a castaway? 

4.
Trials make the promise sweet; 
Trials give new life to prayer; 
Trials bring me to his feet, 
Lay me low, and keep me there.
