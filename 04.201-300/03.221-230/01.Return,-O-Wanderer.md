####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Return, O wanderer, return, 
And seek thy Father's face; 
Those new desires which in thee burn, 
Were kindled by His grace. 

2.
Return, O wanderer, return; 
He hears thy humble sigh; 
He sees thy softened spirit mourn, 
When no one else is nigh. 

3.
Return, O wanderer, return; 
Thy Saviour bids thee live; 
Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn 
How freely He'll forgive. 

4.
Return, O wanderer, return; 
And wipe the falling tear; 
Thy Father calls-no longer mourn; 
'Tis love invites thee near. 

5.
Return, O wanderer, return; 
Regain thy long, sought rest; 
The Saviour's melting mercies yearn 
To clasp thee to his breast.
