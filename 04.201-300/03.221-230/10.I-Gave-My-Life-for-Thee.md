####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
I gave my life for thee, 
My precious blood I shed, 
That thou might'st ransom be, 
And quickened from the dead; 
I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
What hast thou given for me? 
I gave, I gave my life for thee, 
What hast thou given for me? 

2.
My Fathers house of light, 
My glory circled throne, 
I left for earthly night, 
For wanderings sad and lone; 
I left, I left it all for thee, 
Hast thou left aught for me? 
I left, I left it all for thee, 
Hast thou left aught for me? 

3.
I suffered much for thee, 
More than thy tongue can tell, 
Of bitterest agony, 
To rescue thee from hell; 
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
What hast thou borne for me? 
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, 
What hast thou borne for me?
