```txt

1.
Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
Seeking service in thy name; 
All our youth and strength are thine, 
Given to help thy work divine; 
All our love and faith we bring, 
They are thine, O heavenly King. 

2.
Lord of hosts, we ask thine aid, 
Keep us ever unafraid; 
Hold us loyal, hold us true 
To the task we have to do; 
Lead us on to victory, 
We shall triumph praising thee. 

3.
Lord of all, we take our stand, 
Giving help at thy command; 
Eager, joyful, blithe, and strong, 
Thrilled with love and filled with song; 
Lord, we come with hearts aflame, 
Seeking service in thy name.
