1.
O Jesus, thou art standing, 
Outside the fast-closed door, 
In lowly patience waiting 
To pass the threshold o'er: 
Shame on us, Christian brethren, 
His Name and sign who bear, 
O shame, thrice shame upon us, 
To keep him standing there! 

2.
O Jesus, thou art knocking; 
And lo, that hand is scarred, 
And thorns thy brow encircle, 
And tears thy face have marred. 
O love that passeth knowledge, 
So patiently to wait! 
O sin that hath no equal, 
So fast to bar the gate! 

3.
O Jesus, thou art pleading 
In accents meek and low, 
"I died for you, my children, 
And will you treat me so?" 
O Lord, with shame and sorrow 
We open now the door; 
Dear Saviour, enter, enter, 
And leave us never more.
