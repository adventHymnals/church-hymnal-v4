## 234. DEPTH OF MERCY!
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Depth of mercy!'can there be 
Mercy still reserved for me? 
Can my God his wrath forbear? 
Me, the chief of sinners, spare? 

2.
I have long withstood his grace, 
Long provoked him to his face, 
Would not hearken to his calls, 
Grieved him by a thousand falls. 

3.
Now incline me to repent; 
Let me now my sins lament; 
Now my foul revolt deplore, 
Weep, believe, and sin no more. 

4.
There for me the Saviour stands, 
Shows his wounds and spreads his hands; 
God is love! I know, I feel; 
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
