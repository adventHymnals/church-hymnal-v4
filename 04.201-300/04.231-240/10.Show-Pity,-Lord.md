#### Advent Hymnals
## 240. SHOW PITY, LORD
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive! 
Let a repenting sinner live; 
Are not thy mercies large and free? 
May not the guilty trust in thee? 

2.
My crimes, though great, do not surpass 
The power and glory of thy grace; 
O, wash my soul from every sin, 
And make my guilty conscience clean! 

3.
My lips with shame my sins confess, 
Against thy law, against thy grace; 
Lord, should thy judgment be severe, 
I am condemned, but thou art clear. 

4.
Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, 
Whose hope, still hovering'round thy Word, 
Would light on some sweet promise there, 
Some sure support against despair.
