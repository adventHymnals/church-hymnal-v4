#### Advent Hymnals
## 274. MUST JESUS BEAR THE CROSS ALONE?
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt
Major Key: G

1.
Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 
And all the world go free? 
No, there's a cross for everyone,
And there's a cross for me.

2.
The consecrated cross I'll bear
Till He shall set me free; 
And then go home my crown to wear, 
For there's a crown for me.

3.
Upon the crystal pavement, down 
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

```
