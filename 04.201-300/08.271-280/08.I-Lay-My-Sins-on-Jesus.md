```txt
Major Key: F

1.
I lay my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accursed load,
From the accursed load.

2.
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
To wash my crimson stains
White in His blood most precious,
Till not a stain remains,
Till not a stain remains.

3.
I lay my wants on Jesus,
All fullness dwells in Him;
He healeth my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem,
He doth my soul redeem.

4.
I long to be like Jesus,
Meek loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father's holy child,
The Father's holy child.

5.
I long to be with Jesus
Amid the heav'nly throng,
To sing with them His praises,
And learn the angels' song,
And learn the angels' song.
