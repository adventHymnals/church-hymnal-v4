Major Key: F

1.
My Jesus, I love thee, I know Thou art mine; 
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign. 
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou; 
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

2.
I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me, 
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow; 
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

3.
I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

4.
In mansions of glory and endless delight; 
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
