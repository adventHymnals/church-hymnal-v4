## 254. SOMETIMES A LIGHT SURPRISES
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
Sometimes a light surprises 
The Christian while he sings; 
It is the Lord, who rises 
With healing in his wings; 
When comforts are declining, 
He grants the soul again 
A season of clear shining, 
To cheer it after rain. 

2.
In holy contemplation 
We sweetly then pursue 
The theme of God's salvation, 
And find it ever new; 
Set free from present sorrow, 
We cheerfully can say, 
Let the unknown tomorrow 
Bring with it what it may. 

3.
Children of God lack nothing, 
His promise bears them through; 
Who gives the lilies clothing, 
Will clothe his people too; 
Beneath the spreading heavens 
No creature but is fed, 
And he who feeds the ravens 
Will give his children bread. 

5.
Though vine nor fig tree neither 
Their wonted fruit should bear, 
Though all the fields should wither, 
Nor flocks nor herds be there; 
Yet God the same abiding, 
His praise shall tune my voice, 
For while in Him confiding, 
I cannot but rejoice.
