## 252. MY SPIRIT ON THY CARE
####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
My spirit on thy care, 
Blest Saviour, I recline; 
Thou wilt not leave me to despair, 
For Thou art love divine. 

2.
In thee I place my trust, 
On thee I calmly rest; 
I know thee good, I know thee just, 
And count thy choice the best. 

3.
Whate'er events betide, 
Thy will they all perform; 
Safe in Thy breast my head I hide, 
Nor fear the coming storm. 

4.
Let good or ill befall, 
It must be good for me, 
Secure of having Thee in all, 
Of having all in Thee.
