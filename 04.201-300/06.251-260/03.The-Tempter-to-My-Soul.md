####  Church Hymnal 1941,

```txt

1.
The tempter to my soul hath said, 
"There is no help in God for thee;" 
Lord! lift thou up thy servant's head; 
My glory, shield, and solace be. 

2.
Thus to the Lord I raised my cry; 
He heard me from his holy hill; 
At his command the waves rolled by; 
He beckoned, and the winds were still. 

3.
I laid me down and slept, I woke' 
Thou, Lord, my spirit didst sustain; 
Bright, from the east, the morning broke; 
Thy comforts rose on me again. 

4.
I will not fear, though armed throngs 
Compass my steps in all their wrath; 
Salvation to the Lord belongs; 
His presence guards His people's path.
