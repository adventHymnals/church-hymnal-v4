```txt
Major Key: A Flat

1.
I need Thee every hour, Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine Can peace afford.
CHORUS:
I need Thee, O I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

2.
I need Thee every hour; Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their power When Thou art nigh.

3.
I need Thee every hour, In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide, Or life is vain.

4.
I need Thee every hour; Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises In me fulfill.
