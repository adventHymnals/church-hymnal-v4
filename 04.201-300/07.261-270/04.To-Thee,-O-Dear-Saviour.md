1.
To thee, O dear, dear Saviour, 
My spirit turns for rest; 
My peace is in thy favor, 
My pillow on thy breast; 
Though all the world deceive me, 
I know that I am thine, 
And thou wilt never leave me, 
O blessed Saviour mine. 

2.
In thee my trust abideth, 
On thee my hope relies, 
O thou whose love provideth 
For all beneath the skies; 
O thou whose mercy found me, 
From bondage set me free, 
And then forever bound me 
With threefold cords to thee. 

3.
Alas, that I should ever 
Have failed in love to thee, 
The only One who never 
Forgat or slighted me! 
O for a heart to love thee 
More truly as I ought, 
And nothing place above thee 
In deed, or word, or thought. 

4.
O for that choicest blessing 
Of living in thy love, 
And thus on earth possessing 
The peace of heaven above! 
O for the bliss that by it 
The soul securely knows 
The holy calm and quiet 
Of faith's serene repose!
