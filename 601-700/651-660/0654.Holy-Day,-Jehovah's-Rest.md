    1.
    Holy day, Jehovah's rest, 
    Of creation's week the best; 
    Last of all the chosen seven, 
    Blessed of God, to man 'twas given. 
    Refrain:
    Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
    Glad we hail its presence blest, 
    'Tis the great Jehovah's rest. 

    2.
    First His six days' work was done, 
    Then the Sabbath was begun; 
    Thus He blessed the seventh day, 
    Thus in resting we obey. 

    3.
    Thousands have His plan reversed, 
    Resting now upon the first; 
    Search the Book and you shall know 
    There's no scripture tells them so. 

    4.
    All who speak the truth must say 
    It was man who changed the day; 
    In God's word no change appears 
    Through the whole six thousand years! 
    Thus I searched; and when I saw 
    Only one great Sabbath law, 
    Then I hastened to obey' 
    Plainly, 'twas the only way.
