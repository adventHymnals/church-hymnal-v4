    1.
    Give me the Bible,
    Star of gladness gleaming,
    To cheer the wanderer
    Lone and tempest tossed,
    No storm can hide that
    Peaceful radiance beaming
    Since Jesus came
    To seek and save the lost.
    CHORUS:
    Give me the Bible--
    Holy message shining,
    Thy light shall guide me
    In the narrow way.
    Precept and promise,
    Law and love combining,
    'Til night shall vanish
    In eternal day.

    2.
    Give me the Bible
    When my heart is broken,
    When sin and grief have
    Filled my soul with fear,
    Give me the precious
    Words by Jesus spoken,
    Hold up faith's lamp
    To show my Savior near.

    3.
    Give me the Bible,
    All my steps enlighten,
    Teach me the danger
    Of these realms below,
    That lamp of safety,
    O'er the gloom shall brighten,
    That light alone
    The path of peace can show.
