    1.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    This is the promise of love;
    There shall be seasons refreshing,
    Sent from the Savior above.
    Refrain:
    Showers of blessing,
    Showers of blessing we need;
    Mercy drops round us are falling,
    But for the showers we plead.

    2.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    Precious reviving again;
    Over the hills and the valleys,
    Sound of abundance of rain.

    3.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    Send them upon us, O Lord;
    Grant to us now a refreshing;
    Come, and now honor Thy word.

    4.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    O that today they might fall,
    Now as to God we're confessing,
    Now as on Jesus we call!
