    1.
    On the shore beyond the sea, 
    Where the fields are bright and fair, 
    There's a call, a plaintive plea, 
    I must hasten to be there. 
    Refrain:
    Let me go, I cannot stay, 
    'Tis the Master calling me; 
    Let me go, I must obey; 
    Native land, farewell to thee. 

    2.
    Hark! I hear the Master say, 
    "Up, ye reapers! why so slow?" 
    To the vineyard, far away, 
    Earthly kindred, let me go. 

    3.
    Just beyond the rolling tide, 
    The uplifted hand I see; 
    Lo! the gates are open wide, 
    And the lost are calling me. 

    4.
    Father, mother, darling child, 
    I must bid you all adieu; 
    Far across the waters wild, 
    There's a work for me to do.
