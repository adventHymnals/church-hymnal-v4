    1.
    Rest There is a place of quiet rest, 
    Near to the heart of God, 
    A place where sin cannot molest, 
    Near to the heart of God. 
    Refrain:
    O Jesus, blest Redeemer, 
    Sent from the heart of God, 
    Hold us, who wait before Thee, 
    Near to the heart of God. 

    2.
    There is a place of comfort sweet, 
    Near to the heart of God, 
    A place where we our Savior meet, 
    Near to the heart of God. 

    3.
    There is a place of full release, 
    Near to the heart of God, 
    A place where all is joy and peace, 
    Near to the heart of God.
