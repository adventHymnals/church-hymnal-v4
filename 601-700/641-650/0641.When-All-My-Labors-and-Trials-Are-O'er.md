[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11f32hrHSYL05y6OmUiMdc4hh3GZsAZag/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    When all my labors and trials are o'er, 
    And I am safe on that beautiful shore, 
    Just to be near the dear Lord I adore, 
    Will through the ages be glory for me. 
    Refrain:
    O that will be glory for me, 
    Glory for me, glory for me; 
    When by His grace I shall look on His face, 
    That will be glory, be glory for me. 

    2.
    When, by the gift of His infinite grace, 
    I am accorded in Heaven a place, 
    Just to be there and to look on His face, 
    Will through the ages be glory for me. 

    3.
    Friends will be there I have loved long ago; 
    Joy like a river around me will flow; 
    Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know, 
    Will through the ages be glory for me.
