    1.
    The name of Jesus is so sweet, 
    I love its music to repeat; 
    It makes my joys full and complete, 
    The precious name of Jesus. 
    Refrain:
    "Jesus," oh, how sweet the name! 
    "Jesus," every day the same; 
    "Jesus," let all saints proclaim 
    Its worthy praise forever. 

    2.
    I love the name of Him Whose heart 
    Knows all my grief's and bears a part; 
    Who bids all anxious fears depart' 
    I love the name of Jesus. 

    3.
    That name I fondly love to hear, 
    It never fails my heart to cheer, 
    Its music dries the falling tear; 
    Exalt the name of Jesus. 

    4.
    No word of man can ever tell 
    How sweet the name I love so well; 
    Oh, let its praises ever swell; 
    Oh, praise the name of Jesus.
