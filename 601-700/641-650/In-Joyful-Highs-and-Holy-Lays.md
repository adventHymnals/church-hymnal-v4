    1.
    In joyful high and holy lays 
    My soul her grateful voice would raise; 
    But who can sing the worthy praise 
    Of the wonderful love of Jesus? 
    Refrain:
    Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
    Wonderful love of Jesus! 
    Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
    Wonderful love of Jesus! 

    2.
    A joy by day, a peace by night, 
    In storms a calm, in darkness light, 
    In pain a balm, in weakness might, 
    Is the wonderful love of Jesus. 

    3.
    My hope for pardon when I call, 
    My trust for lifting when I fall, 
    In life, in death, my all in all, 
    Is the wonderful love of Jesus.
