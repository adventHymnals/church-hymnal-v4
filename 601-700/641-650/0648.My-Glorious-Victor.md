    1.
    My glorious Victor, Prince Divine, 
    Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
    At length my will is all Thine own, 
    Glad vassal of a Saviour's throne. 

    2.
    My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
    Pierce this now willing ear once more. 
    Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
    With Thee, to toil, endure, obey. 

    3.
    Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will, 
    Use all in Thy dear slavery still! 
    Self's weary liberties I cast 
    Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast. 

    4.
    Tread them still down; and then I know 
    These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow; 
    And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
    Which tells me Thou and I are one.
