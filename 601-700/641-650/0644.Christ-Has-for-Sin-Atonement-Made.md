    1.
    Christ has for sin atonement made, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    We are redeemed! the price is paid! 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    Refrain:
    What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus! 
    What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord! 

    2.
    I praise Him for the cleansing blood, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    That reconciled my soul to God; 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 

    3.
    He cleansed my heart from all its sin, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    And now He reigns and rules therein; 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 

    4.
    He walks beside me in the way, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    And keeps me faithful day by day; 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 

    5.
    He gives me overcoming power, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    And triumph in each trying hour; 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 

    6.
    To Him I've given all my heart, 
    What a wonderful Saviour! 
    The world shall never share a part; 
    What a wonderful Saviour!
