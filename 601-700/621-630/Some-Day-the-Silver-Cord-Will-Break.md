    1.
    Someday the silver cord will break, 
    And I no more as now shall sing; 
    But, O, the joy when I shall wake 
    Within the palace of the King! 
    Refrain:
    And I shall see Him face to face, 
    And tell the story'Saved by grace; 
    And I shall see Him face to face, 
    And tell the story'Saved by grace. 

    2.
    Someday my earthly house will fall, 
    I cannot tell how soon 'twill be, 
    But this I know'my all in all 
    Has now a place in heaven for me. 

    3.
    Someday, when fades the golden sun 
    Beneath the rosy-tinted west, 
    My blessed Lord will say, "Well done!" 
    And I shall enter into rest.
