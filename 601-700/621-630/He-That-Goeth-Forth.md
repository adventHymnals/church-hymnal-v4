    1.
    He that goeth forth with weeping,
    Bearing precious seed in love, 
    Never tiring, never sleeping, 
    Findeth mercy from above. 

    2.
    Soft descend the dews of heaven, 
    Bright the rays celestial shine; 
    Precious fruits will thus be given, 
    Through an influence all divine. 

    3.
    Sow the seed, be never weary; 
    Let no fears thy soul annoy; 
    Be the prospect ne'er so dreary, 
    Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy. 

    4.
    Lo, the scene of verdure brightening! 
    See the rising grain appear; 
    Look again! the fields are whitening, 
    For the harvest time is near.
