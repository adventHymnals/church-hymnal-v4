[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rkZTfSuYsARQDueqxIwPsmxnGMnjwwM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
    Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
    Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
    Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
    CHORUS:
    Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
    Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

    2.
    Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive;
    Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.

    3.
    Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
    Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
