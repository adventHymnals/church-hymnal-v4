    1.
    Brightly beams our Father's mercy, 
    From His lighthouse evermore, 
    But to us He gives the keeping 
    Of the lights along the shore. 
    Refrain:
    Let the lower lights be burning! 
    Send a gleam across the wave! 
    Some poor fainting, struggling seaman 
    You may rescue, you may save. 

    2.
    Dark the night of sin has settled, 
    Loud the angry billows roar; 
    Eager eyes are watching, longing, 
    For the lights along the shore. 

    3.
    Trim You feeble lamp, my brother: 
    Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, 
    Trying now to make the harbor, 
    In the darkness may be lost.
