    1.
    I need Thee precious Jesus, For I am very poor;
    A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
    I need the love of Jesus To cheer me on my way,
    To guide my doubting footsteps, To be my strength and stay.

    2.
    I need the heart of Jesus To feel each anxious care,
    To tell my every trial, And all my sorrows share. 
    I need the Holy Spirit To teach me what I am,
    To show me more of Jesus, To point me to the Lamb.

    3.
    I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
    Encircled with the rainbow, And seated on Thy throne.
    There with Thy blood-bought children, My joy shall ever be
    To sing Thy ceaseless praises, To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.
