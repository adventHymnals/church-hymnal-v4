    1.
    Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
    I do not pray; 
    Keep me, my God, from stain of sin 
    Just for today. 
    Help me to labor earnestly, 
    And duly pray: 
    Let me be kind in word and deed, 
    Father, today. 

    2.
    Let me be slow to do my will, 
    Prompt to obey; 
    Help me to sacrifice myself, 
    Father, today. 
    Let me no wrong or idle word 
    Unthinking say; 
    Set Thou a seal upon my lips 
    Through all today. 

    3.
    Let me in season, Lord, be grave, 
    In season gay; 
    Let me be faithful to Thy grace, 
    Father, today. 
    Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
    I do not pray: 
    Still keep me, guide me, love me, Lord, 
    Through each today.
