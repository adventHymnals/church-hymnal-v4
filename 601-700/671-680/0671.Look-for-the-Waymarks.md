    Major Key: G

    1.
    Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
    Look for the way-marks passing one by one;
    Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four'
    Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o'er.
    CHORUS:
    Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
    Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.
    Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;
    The journey's almost o'er.

    2.
    First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
    Then Medo-Persia's banners were unfurled;
    And after Greece held universal sway,
    Rome seized the scepter--Where are we today?

    3.
    Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
    Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
    What will the next great, glorious drama be?
    Christ and His coming, And eternity.
