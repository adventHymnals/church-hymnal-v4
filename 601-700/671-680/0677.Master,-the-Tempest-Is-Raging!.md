    1.
    Master, the tempest is raging! 
    The billows are tossing high! 
    The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness; 
    No shelter or help is nigh; 
    Carest Thou not that we perish? 
    How canst Thou lie asleep, 
    When each moment so madly is threatening 
    A grave in the angry deep? 
    Refrain:
    "The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
    Peace, be still! 
    Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
    Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
    No water can swallow the ship where lies 
    The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
    They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
    Peace, be still! Peace, be still! 
    They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
    Peace, peace, be still!" 

    2.
    Master, with anguish of spirit 
    I bow in my grief today; 
    The depths of my sad heart are troubled; 
    O, waken and save, I pray! 
    Torrents of sin and of anguish 
    Sweep o'er my sinking soul; 
    And I perish! I perish I dear Master; 
    O hasten, and take control. 

    3.
    Master, the terror is over, 
    The elements sweetly rest; 
    Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored, 
    And heaven's within my breast; 
    Linger, 0 blessed Redeemer, 
    Leave me alone no more; 
    And with joy I shall make the blest harbor, 
    And rest on the blissful shore.
