    1.
    When wilt Thou save the people? 
    O God of mercy, when? 
    Not kings and lords, but nations! 
    Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
    Flowers of Thy heart, O God, are they; 
    Let them not pass, like weeds, away, 
    Their heritage a sunless day. 
    God save the people! 

    2.
    Shall crime bring crime forever, 
    Strength aiding still the strong? 
    Is it Thy will, O Father, 
    That man shall toil for wrong? 
    "No," say Thy mountains; "No," Thy skies; 
    Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise, 
    And songs be heard instead of sighs; 
    God save the people! 

    3.
    When wilt Thou save the people? 
    O God of mercy, when? 
    The people, Lord, the people, 
    Not thrones and crowns, but men! 
    God save the people; Thine they are, 
    Thy children, as Thy angels fair; 
    From vice, oppression, and despair, 
    God save the people!
