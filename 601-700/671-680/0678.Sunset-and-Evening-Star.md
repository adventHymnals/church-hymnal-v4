    1.
    Sunset and evening star, 
    And one clear call for me! 
    And may there be no moaning of the bar 
    When I put out to sea, 

    2.
    But such a tide as moving seems asleep, 
    Too full for sound and foam, 
    When that which drew from out the boundless deep 
    Turns again home. 

    3.
    Twilight and evening bell, 
    And after that the dark! 
    And may there be no sadness of fare-well 
    When I embark; 

    4.
    For, though from out our bourne of time and place 
    The flood may bear me far, 
    I hope to see my Pilot face to face 
    When I have crossed the bar. 
    Amen
