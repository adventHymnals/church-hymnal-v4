[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DrxqW_Oxwmskg2x6YsI0hZeaoA%2DmeVZR/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    I'm pressing on the upward way, 
    New heights I'm gaining every day; 
    Still praying as I onward bound, 
    'Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.' 
    Refrain:
    Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand 
    By faith on heaven's tableland; 
    A higher plane than I have found; 
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. 

    2.
    My heart has no desire to stay 
    Where doubts arise and fears dismay; 
    Though some may dwell where these abound, 
    My prayer, my aim, is higher ground. 

    3.
    I want to live above the world, 
    Though Satan's darts at me are hurled; 
    For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
    The song of saints on higher ground. 

    4.
    I want to scale the utmost height, 
    And catch a gleam of glory bright; 
    But still I'll pray till heaven I've found, 
    'Lord, lead me on to higher ground.'
