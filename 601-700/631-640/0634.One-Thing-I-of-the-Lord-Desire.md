    1.
    One thing I of the Lord desire, 
    For all my paths have miry been, 
    Be it by water or by fire, 
    O make me clean, 
    O make me clean. 
    Refrain:
    So wash me Thou, without, within, 
    Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
    No matter how, if only sin 
    Die out in me, die out in me. 

    2.
    If clearer vision Thou impart, 
    Grateful and glad my soul shall be; 
    But yet to have a purer heart, 
    Is more to me, 
    Is more to me. 

    3.
    Yea, only as this heart is clean 
    May larger vision yet be mine, 
    For mirrored in Thy life are seen 
    The things divine, 
    The things divine 

    4.
    I watch to shun the miry way, 
    And stanch the springs of guilty thought, 
    But watch and struggle as I may, 
    Pure I am not, 
    Pure I am not.
