    1.
    I have a song I love to sing, 
    Since I have been redeemed; 
    Of my Redeemer, Saviour, King, 
    Since I have been redeemed. 
    Refrain:
    Since I have been redeemed, 
    Since I have been redeemed, 
    I will glory in His name, 
    Since I have been redeemed, 
    I will glory in my Saviour's name 

    2.
    I have a Christ that satisfies, 
    Since I have been redeemed; 
    To do His will my highest prize, 
    Since I have been redeemed. 

    3.
    I have a witness bright and clear, 
    Since I have been redeemed; 
    Dispelling every doubt and fear, 
    Since I have been redeemed. 

    4.
    I have a home prepared for me, 
    Since I have been redeemed; 
    Where I shall dwell eternally, 
    Since I have been redeemed.
