    1.
    Redeemed! how I love to proclaim it! 
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
    Redeemed through His infinite mercy, 
    His child, and forever, I am. 
    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed, 
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
    Redeemed, redeemed, 
    His child, and forever, I am. 

    2.
    Redeemed! and so happy in Jesus! 
    No language my rapture can tell; 
    I know that the light of His presence 
    With me doth continually dwell. 

    3.
    I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
    I think of Him all the day long; 
    I sing, for I cannot be silent; 
    His love is the theme of my song. 

    4.
    I know I shall see in His beauty 
    The King in whose law I delight, 
    Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps, 
    And giveth me songs in the night. 

    5.
    I know there's a crown that is waiting, 
    In yonder bright mansion for me; 
    And soon, with the spirits made perfect, 
    At home with the Lord I shall be.
