     1.
    Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, 
    I long for Thine embrace; 
    Closer within Thine arms enfold me, 
    I seek a resting place. 
    Refrain:
    Closer with the cords of love, 
    Draw me to Thyself above; 
    Closer draw me, 
    To Thyself above. 

    2.
    Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me 
    Nor let me leave Thee more; 
    Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, 
    And count my wanderings o'er. 

    3.
    Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me 
    Till I am all like Thee; 
    Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, 
    Till I am pure and free.
