    1.
    O who is this that cometh 
    From Edom's crimson plain. 
    With wounded side, with garments dyed? 
    O tell me now Thy name. 
    "I that saw thy soul's distress, 
    A ransom gave; 
    I that speak in rightiousness, 
    Mighty to save." 
    Refrain:
    Mighty to save, 
    Mighty to save, 
    Mighty to save; 
    Lord, I trust Thy wondrous love, 
    Mighty to save. 

    2.
    O why is Thine apparel, 
    With reeking gore all dyed, 
    Like them that tread the wine press red? 
    O why this bloody tide? 
    "I the wine press trod alone, 
    'Neath darkening skies; 
    Of the people there was none 
    Mighty to save." 

    3.
    O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour! 
    How could'st Thou bear this shame? 
    With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought 
    Salvation in My name; 
    I the bloody fight have won, 
    Conquered the grave, 
    Now the year of joy has come' 
    Mighty to save."
