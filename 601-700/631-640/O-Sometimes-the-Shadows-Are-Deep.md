    1.
    O sometimes the shadows are deep, 
    And rough seems the path to the goal; 
    And sorrows, how often they sweep 
    Like tempests down over the soul! 
    Refrain:
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I. 
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I. 

    2.
    O sometimes how long seems the day, 
    And sometimes how heavy my feet; 
    But toiling in life's dusty way, 
    The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet! 

    3.
    O near to the Rock let me keep, 
    Or blessings or sorrows prevail; 
    Or climbing the mountain way steep, 
    Or walking the shadowy vale.
