    Major Key: F

    1.
    Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, Thy better portion trace;
    Rise from transitory things Toward heaven, thy native place;
    Sun, and moon, and stars decay; Time shall soon this earth remove;
    Rise, my soul, and haste away To seats prepared above.

    2.
    Rivers to the ocean run, Nor stay in all their course;
    Fire ascending seeks the sun; Both speed them to their source;
    So a soul that's born of God, Longs to view His glorious face,
    Forward tends to His abode To rest in His embrace.

    3.
    Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn; Press onward to the prize;
    Soon our Savior will return, Triumphant in the skies;
    Yet a season, and you know Happy entrance will be given,
    All our sorrows left below, And earth exhcanged for heaven.
