    1.
    Awake, my soul, in joyful lays, 
    And sing thy great Redeemer's praise; 
    He justly claims a song from me; 
    His lovingkindness, O how free! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how free! 

    2.
    He saw me ruined in the fall, 
    Yet loved me notwithstanding all; 
    He saved me from my lost estate; 
    His lovingkindness, O how great! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how great! 

    3.
    Though numerous hosts of mighty foes, 
    Though earth and hell my way oppose, 
    He safely leads my soul along: 
    His lovingkindness, O how strong! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how strong! 

    4.
    When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, 
    Has gathered thick and thundered loud, 
    He near my soul has always stood: 
    His lovingkindness, O how good! 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, O how good! 

    5.
    And when earth's rightful King shall come 
    To take His ransomed people home, 
    I'll sing upon that blissful shore 
    His lovingkindness, evermore. 
    Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, 
    His lovingkindness, evermore.
