    1.
    O Jesus, my Redeemer, 
    Thou art my joy and song, 
    My Saviour and my solace 
    When griefs around me throng. 
    Refrain:
    O Jesus, my Redeemer, 
    My song shall be of Thee; 
    No other friend so constant, 
    No friend so dear to me. 

    2.
    Thou art my hope and comfort 
    Through all the weary years, 
    When shadows dark surround me, 
    When fall the bitter tears. 

    3.
    I trust in Thee, my Saviour, 
    My faithful Friend and Guide; 
    For Thou to me art dearer 
    Than all on earth beside. 

    4.
    My song and my rejoicing 
    While in this world of sin, 
    My song and my rejoicing 
    The heavenly gates within.
