[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UbrnamIX6GYy2FfPQKNKQTyGRzxJK3s/edit?mode=html)




    1.
    The home where changes never come, 
    Nor pain nor sorrow, toil nor care; 
    Yes! 'tis a bright and blessed home; 
    Who would not fain he resting there? 
    Refrain:
    O wait! meekly wait, and murmur not, 
    O wait! meekly wait, and murmur not; 
    O wait! 0 wait! O wait! and murmur not. 

    2.
    Yet when bowed down beneath the load 
    By Heaven allowed, thine earthly lot; 
    Thou yearnest to reach that blest abode, 
    Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not. 

    3.
    If in thy path some thorns are found, 
    O, think who bore them on His brow; 
    If grief thy sorrowing heart has found, 
    It reached a holier than thou. 

    4.
    Toil on, nor deem, though sore it be, 
    One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot; 
    The day of rest will dawn for thee! 
    Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.
