    1.
    Lead on, O King eternal,
    The day of march has come;
    Henceforth in fields of conquest
    Thy tents shall be our home.
    Through days of preparation
    Thy grace has made us strong;
    And now, O King eternal,
    We lift our battle song.

    2.
    Lead on, O King eternal,
    Till sin's fierce war shall cease,
    And holiness shall whisper
    The sweet amen of peace.
    For not with swords loud clashing,
    Nor roll of stirring drums;
    With deeds of love and mercy
    The heavenly kingdom comes.

    3.
    Lead on, O King eternal,
    We follow, not with fears,
    For gladness breaks like morning
    Where'er Thy face appears.
    Thy cross is lifted o'er us,
    We journey in its light;
    The crown awaits the conquest;
    Lead on, O God of might.
