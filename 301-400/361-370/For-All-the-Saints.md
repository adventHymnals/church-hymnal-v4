    1.
    For all the saints
    Who from their labors rest,
    Who Thee by faith
    Before the world confessed.
    Thy name, O Jesus,
    Be forever blest.
    Alleluia!
    Alleluia!

    2.
    Thou wast their Rock,
    Their Fortress and their Might;
    Thou, Lord, their Captain
    In the well-fought fight;
    Thou, in the darkness drear,
    Their one true Light.
    Alleluia!
    Alleluia!

    3.
    O may Thy soldiers,
    Faithful, true, and bold,
    Fight as the saints
    Who nobly fought of old,
    And win with them
    The victor's crown of gold.
    Alleluia!
    Alleluia!

    4.
    And when the strife is fierce,
    The warfare long,
    Steals on the ear
    The distant triumph song,
    And hearts are brave again,
    And arms are strong.
    Alleluia!
    Alleluia!

    5.
    From earth�s wide bounds,
    From ocean�s farthest coast,
    Thro� gates of pearl
    Streams in the countless host,
    Singing to Father,
    Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Alleluia!
    Alleluia!
