    1.
    We're bound for the land of the pure and the holy, 
    The home of the happy, the kingdom of love; 
    Ye wanderers from God, in the broad road of folly, 
    O say, will you go to the Eden above? 
    Refrain:
    Will you go, will you go, will you go, will you go? 
    O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

    2.
    In that blessed land, neither sighing nor anguish 
    Can breathe in the fields where the glorified rove; 
    Ye heart-burdened ones, who in misery languish 
    O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

    3.
    Nor fraud, nor deceit, nor the hand of oppression, 
    Can injure the dwellers in that holy grove; 
    No wickedness there, not a shade of transgression; 
    O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

    4.
    No poverty there, no, the saints are all wealthy, 
    The heirs of His glory whose nature is love; 
    No sickness can reach them, that country is healthy; 
    O say, will you go to the Eden above? 

    5.
    And yet, guilty sinner, we would not forsake thee, 
    We halt yet a moment as onward we move; 
    O, come to thy Lord! in His arms He will take thee, 
    And bear thee along to the Eden above.
