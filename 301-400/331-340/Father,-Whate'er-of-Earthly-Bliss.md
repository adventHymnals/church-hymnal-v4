    1.
    Father, whate'er of earthly bliss 
    Thy sovereign will denies, 
    Accepted at Thy throne of grace 
    Let this petition rise. 

    2.
    Give me a calm, a thankful, heart, 
    From every murmur free; 
    The blessings of Thy grace impart, 
    And make me live to Thee. 

    3.
    Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine 
    My life and death attend: 
    Thy presence through my journey shine, 
    And crown my journey's end.
