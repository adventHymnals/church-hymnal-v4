[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FmH5JppJaAjcnFR1K6i3fek8r03RsPv9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Alone with Thee, my Godin prayer 
    Fain would I from the world repair, 
    AAnd leave the sordid things of life 
    To rest from toil, to cease from strife. 

    2.
    Alone with Thee when breaks the morn, 
    When joyous youth and hope are born. 
    My Friend and Guardian from my birth, 
    Guide all my wanderings trough this earth. 

    3.
    Alone with Thee at blazing noon, 
    E'en youth and strength pass swift and soon. 
    I would not wait till comes the night 
    But yield to Thee my man-hood's might. 

    4.
    Alone with Thee when night is nigh 
    And darkness steals across the sky. 
    With Thee I'd brave death's chilling tide 
    And stand at last on Canaan's side.
