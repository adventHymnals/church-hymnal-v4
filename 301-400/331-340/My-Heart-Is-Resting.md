[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G%2DszhsDc0JtMJee8wWWLs7l31zZQb4Qz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My heart is resting, O my God, 
    I will give thanks and sing; 
    My heart is at the secret source 
    Of every precious thing. 

    2.
    I thirst for springs of heavenly life, 
    And here an day they rise; 
    I seek the treasure of Thy love, 
    And close at hand it lies. 

    3.
    I have a heritage of joy, 
    That yet I must not see; 
    The hand that bled to make it mine 
    Is keeping it for me. 

    4.
    There is a certainty of love 
    That sets my heart at rest; 
    A calm assurance for today, 
    That to be poor is best. 

    5.
    A prayer, reposing on His truth, 
    Who hath made all things mine, 
    That draws my captive will to Him, 
    And makes it one with Thine.
