    1.
    One sweetly solemn thought 
    Comes to me o'er and o'er; 
    Nearer to my home today am I 
    Than e'er I've been before. 

    2.
    Nearer my Father's house, 
    Where many mansions be; 
    Nearer today, the great white throne, 
    Nearer the crystal sea. 

    3.
    Nearer the bound of life 
    Where burdens are laid down; 
    Nearer to leave the heavy cross, 
    Nearer to gain the crown. 

    4.
    But lying darkly between, 
    Winding down through the night, 
    There rolls the deep and unknown stream 
    That leads at last to light. 

    5.
    Father, perfect my trust; 
    Strengthen my power of faith! 
    Nor let me stand, at last, alone 
    Upon the shore of death.
