    1.
    Christian, seek not yet repose, Cast thy dreams of ease away;
    Thou art in the midst of foes; Watch and pray!

    2.
    Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;
    Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!

    3.
    Hear the victors who o'ercame; Still they mark each warrior's way;
    All with one sweet voice exclaim: Watch and pray!

    4.
    Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;
    Hide within thy heart His word; Watch and pray!

    5.
    Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of the day;
    Pray that help may be sent down; Watch and pray!
