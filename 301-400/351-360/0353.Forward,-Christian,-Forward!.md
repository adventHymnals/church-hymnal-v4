[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JjKdOhC8EvTNgdbsiKyhiQZl7yVm-dGH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Forward, Christian, forward! spread abroad the cry; 
    Shout aloud the watchword, "Jesus draweth nigh!" 
    Wave the gospel standard, banner of His love; 
    Sing, as marching onward to your home above. 

    2.
    Forward, Christian, forward! Christ thy life, thy song; 
    Trust in "Jesus only," in His strength be strong; 
    Christ, the glorious leader of the blood-bought band; 
    Follow, closely follow, to the heavenly land. 

    3.
    Sound your hallelujahs, praise to Jesus bring; 
    Magnify His glories, of His coming sing; 
    Sing amidst the conflict, shout the battle cry: 
    "Jesus Christ is coming; on to victory!" 

    4.
    Haste, thou glorious morning! Welcome, shadeless day! 
    Chasing with thy sunlight all our tears away; 
    Haste, O wondrous moment, when 'midst radiant skies 
    Sleeping saints and living at His Word arise.
