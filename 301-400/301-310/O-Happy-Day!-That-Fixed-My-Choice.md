    1.
    O happy day! that fixed my choice 
    On Thee, my Saviour and my God; 
    Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
    And tell its raptures all abroad. 
    Refrain:
    Happy day, happy day, 
    When Jesus washed my sins away! 
    He taught me how to watch and pray, 
    And live rejoicing every day; 
    Happy day, happy day, 
    When Jesus washed my sins away! 

    2.
    'Tis done, the great transaction's done; 
    I am my Lord's, and He is mine; 
    He drew me and I followed on, 
    Charmed to confess the voice divine. 

    3.
    Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
    Fixed on this blissful center, rest; 
    Nor ever from thy Lord depart, 
    With Him of every good possessed. 

    4.
    High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, 
    That vow renewed shall daily hear, 
    Till in time's latest hour I bow, 
    And bless at last a bond so dear. 

    5.
    And when the bright celestial train. 
    From highest heaven to earth shall come; 
    Then with my Lord I'll rise, and reign 
    Forever in that happy home.
