    1.
    There is a happy land, 
    Far, far away, 
    Where saints in glory stand, 
    Bright, bright as day. 
    O! how they sweetly sing, 
    "Worthy is our Saviour King;" 
    Loud let His praises ring, 
    Praise, praise for aye. 

    2.
    Come to that happy land 
    Come, come away; 
    Why will ye doubting stand? 
    Why still delay? 
    O! we shall happy be, 
    From all sin and sorrow free; 
    Lord, we shall live with Thee, 
    Blest, blest for aye. 

    3.
    Bright in that happy land 
    Beams every eye; 
    Kept by a Father's hand, 
    Love cannot die; 
    Then shall Thy kingdom come, 
    Saints have a glorious home; 
    And, brighter than the sun, 
    Reign, reign for aye.
