    1.
    Here We've no abiding city here; 
    Sad truth, were this to be our home; 
    But let this thought our spirits cheer, 
    We seek a city yet to come, 
    We seek a city yet to come. 

    2.
    We've no abiding city here, 
    We seek a city out of sight; 
    Zion its name'the Lord is there' 
    It shines with everlasting light, 
    It shines with everlasting light. 

    3.
    O sweet abode of peace and love, 
    Where pilgrims, freed from toil, are blest! 
    Had I the pinions of a dove, 
    I'd fly to thee, and be at rest, 
    I'd fly to thee, and be at rest. 

    4.
    But hush, my soul! nor dare repine; 
    The time my God appoints is best; 
    While here, to do His will be mine, 
    And His to fix my time of rest, 
    And His to fix my time of rest.
