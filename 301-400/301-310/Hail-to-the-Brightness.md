    1.
    Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! 
    Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain! 
    Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning; 
    Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign. 

    2.
    Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing; 
    Streams ever copious are gliding along; 
    Loud, from the mountaintops echoes are ringing; 
    Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song. 

    3.
    See, the dead risen from land and from ocean; 
    Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high; 
    Fallen the engines of war and commotion, 
    Shouts of salvation are rending the sky. 
    Reign, reign for aye.
