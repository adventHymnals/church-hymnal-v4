    1.
    Come, my soul, thy suit prepare! 
    Jesus loves to answer prayer; 
    He Himself has bid thee pray, 
    Therefore will not say thee nay. 

    2.
    With my burden I begin: 
    Lord, remove this load of sin; 
    Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt, 
    Set my conscience free from guilt. 

    3.
    Lord, I come to Thee for rest, 
    Take possession of my breast: 
    There, Thy sovereign right maintain, 
    And without a rival reign.
