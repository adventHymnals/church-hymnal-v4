    1.
    What a friend we have in Jesus,
    All our sins and griefs to bear!
    What a privilege to carry
    Everything to God in prayer!
    Oh, what peace we often forfeit;
    Oh, what needless pain we bear
    All because we do not carry
    Everything to God in prayer!

    2.
    Have we trials and temptations?
    Is there trouble anywhere?
    We should never be discouraged
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.
    Can we find a friend so faithful
    Who will all our sorrows share?
    Jesus knows our every weakness
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.

    3.
    Are we weak and heavy laden,
    Cumbered with a load of care?
    Precious Savior, still our refuge
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.
    Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.
    In His arms He'll take and shield thee;
    Thou will find a solace there.
