    1.
    Away I love to steal awhile away 
    From every cumbering care, 
    And spend the hours of setting day 
    In humble, grateful prayer. 

    2.
    I love in solitude to shed 
    The penitential tear; 
    And all His promises to plead, 
    Where none but God can hear. 

    3.
    I love to think on mercies past, 
    And future good implore; 
    And all my cares and sorrows cast 
    On Him whom I adore. 

    4.
    I love by faith to take a view 
    Of brighter scenes to come; 
    The prospect doth my strength renew 
    While here away from home.
