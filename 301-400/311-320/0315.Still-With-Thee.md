    1. 
    Still with Thee, O my God! 
    I would desire to be; 
    By day, by night, at home, abroad, 
    I would be still with Thee. 

    2.
    With Thee when dawn comes in, 
    And calls me back to care; 
    Each day returning to begin 
    With Thee, my God, in prayer. 

    3.
    With Thee when day is done, 
    And evening calms the mind; 
    The setting, as the rising sun, 
    With Thee my heart would find. 

    4.
    With Thee, in Thee, by faith 
    Abiding I would be; 
    By day, by night, in life, in death, 
    I would be still with Thee.
