[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXKwPovjjXW7kKEDaxfpffd3wDOEsudT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a safe and secret place 
    Beneath the wings divine, 
    Reserved for all the heirs of grace; 
    O, be that refuge mine! 

    2.
    The least and feeblest there may bide, 
    Uninjured and unawed; 
    While thousands fall on every side, 
    He rests secure in God. 

    3.
    He feeds in pastures large and fair, 
    Of love and truth divine; 
    O child of God, 0 glory's heir! 
    How rich a lot is thine! 

    4.
    A hand almighty to defend, 
    An ear for every call, 
    An honored life, a peaceful end, 
    And heaven to crown it all.
