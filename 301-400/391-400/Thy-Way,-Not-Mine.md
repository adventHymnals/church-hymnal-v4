    1.
    Thy way, not mine, O Lord, 
    However dark it be; 
    Lead me by Thine own hand, 
    Choose out the path for me. 

    2.
    Smooth let it be or rough, 
    It will be still the best; 
    Winding or straight, it leads 
    Right onward to Thy rest 

    3.
    I dare not choose my lot; 
    I would not, if I might; 
    Choose Thou for me, my God. 
    So shall I walk arigh. 

    4.
    The kingdom that I seek 
    Is Thine; so let the way 
    That leads to it be Thine, 
    Else I must surely stray. 

    5.
    Not mine, not mine the choice 
    In things or great or small; 
    Be Thou my guide, my strength, 
    My wisdom, and my all.
