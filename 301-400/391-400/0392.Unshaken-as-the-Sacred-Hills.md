    1.
    Unshaken as the sacred hills, 
    And fixed as mountains stand, 
    Firm as a rock the soul shall rest 
    That trusts th' Almighty hand. 

    2.
    Not walls nor hills could guard so well 
    Fair Salem's happy ground 
    As those eternal arms of love 
    That every saint surround. 

    3.
    Do good, O Lord, do good to those 
    Who cleave to Thee in heart, 
    Who on Thy truth alone repose, 
    Nor from Thy law depart.
