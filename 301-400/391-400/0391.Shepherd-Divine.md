    1.
    Shepherd divine, Thou leadest me 
    Where the still waters gently flow; 
    In pastures fair Thou feedest me; 
    I trust Thy love, no want I know. 

    2.
    In danger's hour Thou hidest me, 
    Safe from the foe of Thy dear flock; 
    At sultry noon Thou guidest me, 
    To rest beside the cooling rock. 

    3.
    When chilling dews of evening fall, 
    Then to the fold Thou bidst me come; 
    Gladly I hasten at Thy call; 
    Sweet is the voice that calls me home.
