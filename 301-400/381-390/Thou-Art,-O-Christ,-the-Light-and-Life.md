[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LGZOItMDHdklyPPxfKz7GwTd6h6Ao3nX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thou art, O Christ, the light and life 
    Of all my soul's aspiring hope; 
    Without that life in daily strife 
    I could not dare with sin to cope. 

    2.
    I have not strength to stand alone, 
    When storms of doubt and fears assail; 
    But Thou, yea, Thou, and Thou alone, 
    Must o'er my doubts and fears prevail. 

    3.
    I have not courage to resist, 
    When Satan's hosts attack me sore; 
    I must on Thee alone subsist, 
    Till sin and sorrow reign no more. 

    4.
    And when, in that bright realm above, 
    I see Thee ever face to face, 
    I'll breathe the fragrance of Thy love, 
    I'll sing the wonder of Thy grace.
