    1.
    More love to Thee, O Christ, More love to Thee!
    Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
    This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
    More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

    2.
    Once earthly joy I craved, Sought peace and rest;
    Now Thee alone I seek, Give what is best.
    This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
    More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

    3.
    Let sorrow do its work, Send grief or pain;
    Sweet are Thy messengers, Sweet their refrain,
    When they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
    More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

    4.
    Then shall my latest breath Whisper Thy praise;
    This be the parting cry My heart shall raise;
    This still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee;
    More love to Thee, More love to Thee!
