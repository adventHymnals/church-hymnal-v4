    1.
    Lord, in the fullness of my might, 
    I would for Thee be strong; 
    While runneth o'er each dear delight 
    To Thee should soar my song. 

    2.
    I would not give the world my heart, 
    And then profess Thy love; 
    I would not feel my strength depart 
    And then Thy service prove. 

    3.
    I would not with swift-winged zeal 
    On the world's errands go; 
    And labor up the heavenly hill 
    With weary feet and slow. 

    4.
    Oh, not for Thee my weak desires, 
    My poorer, baser part! 
    Oh, not for Thee my fading fires, 
    The ashes of my heart! 

    5.
    Oh, choose me in my golden time! 
    In my dear joys have part! 
    For Thee the glory of my prime, 
    The fullness of my heart!
