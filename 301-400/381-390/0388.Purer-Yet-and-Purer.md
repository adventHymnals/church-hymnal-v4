    1.
    Purer yet and purer 
    I would be in mind, 
    Dearer every and dearer 
    Every duty find; 
    Hoping still and trusting 
    God without a fear, 
    Patiently believing 
    He will make all clear. 

    2.
    Calmer yet and calmer 
    In the hours of pain, 
    Surer yet and surer 
    Peace at last to gain; 
    Suffer still and doing, 
    To His will resigned, 
    And to God subduing 
    Heart and will and mind. 

    3.
    Higher yet and higher 
    Out of clouds and night, 
    Nearer yet and nearer 
    Rising to the light-- 
    Light serene and holy, 
    Where my soul may rest, 
    Purified and lowly, 
    Sanctified and blest. 

    4.
    Swifter yet and swifter 
    Ever onward run, 
    Firmer yet and firmer 
    Step as I go on; 
    Oft these earnest longings 
    Swell within my breast, 
    Yet their inner meaning 
    Ne'er can be expressed.
