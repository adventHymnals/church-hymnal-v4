[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L90OsEJ4qkAZ8cVBXyE7NwGYZwO6bdL8/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O who, in such a world as this, 
    Could bear his lot of pain, 
    Did not one radiant hope of bliss 
    Unclouded yet remain? 

    2.
    That hope the sovereign Lord has given 
    Who reigns above the skies; 
    Hope that unites the soul to heaven 
    By faith's endearing ties. 

    3.
    Each care, each ill of mortal birth, 
    Is sent in pitying love, 
    To lift the hungering heart from earth 
    And speed its flight above. 

    4.
    And every pang that wrings the breast, 
    And every joy that dies, 
    Bids us to seek a purer rest 
    And trust to holier ties.
