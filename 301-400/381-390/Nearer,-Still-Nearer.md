    1.
    Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
    Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
    Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
    Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,
    Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.

    2.
    Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
    Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-
    Only my sinful now contrite heart,
    Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
    Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

    3.
    Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;
    Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
    All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
    Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
    Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

    4.
    Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;
    Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
    Through endless ages, ever to be,
    Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
    Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
