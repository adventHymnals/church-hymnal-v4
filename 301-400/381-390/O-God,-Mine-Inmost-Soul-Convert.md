[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQaXdmJJpIkL%2DzLXhaGuPEgGxAcgQDvB/edit?mode=html)



    1.O God, mine inmost soul convert, 
    And deeply on my thoughtful heart 
    Eternal things impress; 
    Give me to feel their solemn weigh, 
    And save me ere it be too late; 
    Wake me to righteousness. 

    2.Before me place in dread array 
    The pomp of that tremendous day 
    When Thou with clouds shalt come 
    To judge the nations at Thy bar; 
    And tell me, Lord, shall I be there, 
    To hear Thy welcome home? 

    3.
    Be this my one great business here, 
    With serious industry and fear 
    Eternal bliss t' ensure 
    Thy utmost counsel to fulfill, 
    And suffer all Thy righteousness will, 
    And to the end endure. 

    4.
    Then, Father, then my soul receive, 
    Transported from this vale, to live 
    And reign with Thee above, 
    Where faith is sweetly lost in sight, 
    And hope in full, supreme delight, 
    And everlasting love.
