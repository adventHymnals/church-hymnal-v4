    1.
    O Master, let me walk with Thee
    In lowly paths of service free;
    Tell me Thy secret; help me bear
    The strain of toil, the fret of care.

    2.
    Help me the slow of heart to move
    By some clear, winning word of love;
    Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
    And guide them in the homeward way.

    3.
    Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee
    In closer, dearer company,
    In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
    In trust that triumphs over wrong;

    4.
    In hope that sends a shining ray
    Far down the future's broadening way,
    In peace that only Thou canst give,
    With Thee, O Master, let me live.
