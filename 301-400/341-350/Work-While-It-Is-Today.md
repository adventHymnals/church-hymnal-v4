    1.
    Work while it is today! 
    This was our Saviour's rule; 
    With docile minds let us obey, 
    As learners in His school. 

    2.
    Lord Christ, we humbly ask 
    Of Thee the power and will, 
    With fear and meekness, every task 
    Of duty to fulfil. 

    3.
    At home, by word and deed, 
    Adorn redeeming grace; 
    And sow abroad the precious seed 
    Of truth in every place' 

    4.
    That thus the wilderness 
    May blossom like the rose, 
    And trees spring up of righteousness, 
    Where'er life's river flows.
