    1.
    Come unto me when shadows darkly gather, 
    When the sad heart is weary and distressed; 
    Seeking for comfort from your heavenly Father, 
    Come unto me, and I will give you rest. 

    2.
    Large are the mansions in our Father's dwelling, 
    Glad are those homes that sorrows never dim; 
    Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling, 
    Soft are the tones that raise the heavenly hymn. 

    3.
    There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness, 
    Bloom the fair flowers by earth so rudely pressed; 
    Come unto Him all ye who droop in sadness, 
    "Come unto Me, and I will give you rest."
