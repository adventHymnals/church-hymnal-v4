    1.
    In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
    Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
    When Thou see'st me waver, With a look recall,
    Nor, for fear or favor, Suffer me to fall.

    2.
    With forbidden pleasures Would this vain world charm;
    Or its sordid treasures Spread to work me harm;
    Bring to my remembrance Sad Gethsemane,
    Or, in darker semblance, Cross-crowned Calvary.

    3.
    Should Thy mercy send me Sorrow, toil, and woe,
    Or should pain attend me On my path below,
    Grant that I may never Fail Thy hand to see;
    Grant that I may ever Cast my care on Thee.
