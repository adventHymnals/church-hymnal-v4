    1.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
    And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
    If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
    What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
    CHORUS:
    Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,
    What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

    2.
    'is the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
    With a tender compassion His children to hear;
    When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,
    What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

    3.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
    To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;
    With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;
    What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

    4.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,
    That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive;
    In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
    What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
