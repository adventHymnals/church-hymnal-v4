[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GtauxKu7KAV7hsYhFyksjCMSNgIYTT9_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is sweet rest for feet now weary, 
    In the rugged, upward way; 
    There is a morn when midnight dreary 
    Shall be lost in perfect day. 

    2.
    For that blest morn our hearts are longing, 
    When shall end earth's night of woe; 
    When, through those pearly portals thronging, 
    Mortal cares we'll leave below. 

    3.
    Soon to that city, bright, eternal, 
    Weary pilgrims all shall go; 
    Soon we shall rest in pastures vernal, 
    Where life's waters ceaseless flow. 

    4.
    Father above, in mercy guide us 
    To those mansions of the blest; 
    Safe in the Rock of Ages hide us 
    Till we gain our final rest.
