    1.
    A few more years shall roll, 
    A few more seasons come, 
    And we shall meet the loved who now 
    Are sleeping in the tomb. 
    Then, O my Lord, prepare 
    My soul for that great day; 
    O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
    And take my sins away! 

    2.
    A few more storms shall beat 
    On this wild, rocky shore, 
    And we shall be where tempests cease, 
    And surges swell no more. 
    Then, O my Lord, prepare 
    My soul for that calm day; 
    O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
    And take my sins away! 

    3.
    A few more struggles here, 
    A few more partings sore, 
    A few more toils, a few more tears, 
    And we shall weep no more. 
    Then, O my Lord, prepare 
    My soul for that blest day; 
    O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
    And take my sins away! 

    4.
    'Tis but a little while, 
    And He shall come again, 
    Who died that we might live, who lives 
    That we may with Him reign. 
    Then, O my Lord, prepare 
    My soul for that glad day; 
    O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
    And take my sins away!
