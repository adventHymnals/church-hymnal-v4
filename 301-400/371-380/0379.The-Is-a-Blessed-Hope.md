    1.
    There is a blessed hope, 
    More precious and more bright 
    Than all the joyless mockery 
    The world esteems delight. 

    2.
    There is a lovely star 
    That lights the darkest gloom, 
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er 
    The prospects of the tomb. 

    3.
    There is a cheering voice 
    That lifts the soul above, 
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt, 
    And whispers, "God is love," 

    4.
    That voice from Calvary's height 
    Proclaims the forgiven; 
    That star is revelation's light, 
    That hope, the hope of heaven.
